_The art of weaving resources into regenerative systems._

In the world of regenerative development, capital is not just financial‚Äîit is the lifeblood of transformation, flowing through ecological, social, cultural, and economic systems. At Prisma, **Capital Distribution** is more than a mechanism for allocating resources; it is a practice of honoring relationships, stewarding energy flows, and enabling communities to thrive. It is how we ensure that value creation aligns with the essence of place and the shared aspirations of those involved in our [[Action-learning journeys]].

## **A Philosophy of Flow**

Capital Distribution begins with a simple yet profound question: _How can resources serve the greatest potential of this place and its people?_

In conventional systems, capital often moves hierarchically‚Äîcontrolled by centralized authorities who dictate its use. But in regenerative systems, capital flows like water through a watershed‚Äînourishing what needs to grow, adapting to changing conditions, and replenishing itself through cycles of reciprocity. This philosophy drives our approach to distributing resources in ways that are transparent, participatory, and deeply attuned to local contexts.

## **The Prisma Approach**

At Prisma, Capital Distribution is guided by three core principles:

1. **Transparency:**  
    Every resource flow is visible to all stakeholders. Using tools like [[Holochain]]-enabled DAOs and [[smart contracts]], we ensure that decisions about resource allocation are made collaboratively and can be traced back to their origins.
    
2. **Equity:**  
    Resources are distributed based on need and potential rather than power or privilege. This means prioritizing marginalized voices and ensuring that every stakeholder has an equal say in how capital is used.
    
3. **Regenerative Impact:**  
    Capital is allocated to initiatives that enhance systemic health across the [[g. Five Spheres of Evaluation]]‚Äîecological, social, cultural, political, and economic.
    

## **How It Works**

## 1. Decentralized Governance

Capital Distribution begins with community-led decision-making processes facilitated through [[DAOs|Decentralized Autonomous Organizations]]. These DAOs act as living systems where stakeholders vote on how resources should be allocated based on real-time data from our [[developmental evaluation]] framework.

**Example:**  
During the Accra ALJ, the DAO enabled participants to allocate funds toward youth-led recycling initiatives after evaluating their impact on waste diversion and local employment.

## 2. Proof Systems

We use innovative proof mechanisms like [[Speech-to-Currency]] and [[proof of impact]] to link contributions directly to resource flows. These systems ensure that every act of value creation‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs planting mangroves or facilitating workshops‚Äîis recognized and rewarded.

**Example:**  
A facilitator who designs a culturally resonant workshop receives tokens via the speech-to-currency system, which can then be spent within the bioregion‚Äôs local economy.

## 3. Multi-Capital Framework

Capital Distribution isn‚Äôt limited to financial assets; it encompasses eight forms of capital: natural üå±, social üë•, human üß†, cultural üé®, political üèõÔ∏è, financial üí∞, built üèóÔ∏è, and digital üíª. By tracking flows across these capitals, we ensure that resources are used holistically to regenerate systems rather than deplete them.

**Example:**  
In a coastal village restoring mangroves:

- **Natural Capital:** Funds for planting trees.
    
- **Social Capital:** Training youth in ecological stewardship.
    
- **Cultural Capital:** Reviving traditional practices tied to mangrove care.
    

## **The Role of Technology**

Technology plays a critical role in enabling transparent and participatory Capital Distribution:

- **Smart Contracts:** Automate fund allocation based on predefined criteria (e.g., ecological health metrics).
    
- **Holochain DAOs:** Facilitate decentralized decision-making while ensuring data sovereignty for communities.
    
- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Visualize resource flows across spheres and capitals in real time for all stakeholders to see.
    

These tools don‚Äôt replace human judgment but enhance it‚Äîproviding communities with the information they need to make informed decisions while safeguarding transparency and accountability.

## **Why It Matters**

Capital Distribution isn‚Äôt just about moving money; it‚Äôs about creating ecosystems where resources flow in harmony with life‚Äôs rhythms. When done well:

- It empowers communities to take ownership of their development journeys.
    
- It ensures that interventions align with local needs rather than external agendas.
    
- It fosters trust by making resource flows visible and participatory.
    

But perhaps most importantly, it transforms capital from a tool of extraction into a force for regeneration‚Äîa way to nourish ecosystems rather than exploit them.

## **Case Study: Accra ALJ**

During the Accra ALJ:

1. Funds were pooled into a DAO governed by participants from [[communities of place]].
    
2. Decisions about allocation were made collaboratively using real-time insights from Telegram bots tracking waste diversion rates and community engagement metrics.
    
3. Resources were distributed across multiple forms of capital: financial grants for microbusinesses (economic), training programs for youth leaders (human), and cultural initiatives celebrating traditional crafts (cultural).
    

This approach not only ensured equitable distribution but also catalyzed systemic change across the bioregion.

## **A Call to Stewardship**

Capital Distribution is not just an operational process‚Äîit is an act of care. It asks us to listen deeply to the needs of people and place, to honor the relationships that sustain us, and to use resources as tools for healing rather than harm.

As we continue this work at Prisma, we hold this practice with reverence‚Äîknowing that every decision we make about capital flows shapes the future we are building together.
