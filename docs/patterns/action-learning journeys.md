Action-learning journeys serve as the container by which communities aim to periodically embody the conditions required for an alternate future. Through several weeks of onboarding and alignment leading up to the event, cohorts of participants organise themselves in ways that demonstrate new capabilities for a given system to be able to express itself. This alignment period ends with an intensive, lasting several weeks.
