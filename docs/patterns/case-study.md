each action-learning journey produces a story. this is a story about the application of practice on-the-ground among networks of real people and places. practice is applied to grow the capacity for evolution of these systems, so that they can work toward realising their potential and expressing their essence. 

capacity-building has many dimensions. we call these dimensions [[aspect|aspects]].[^1] each aspect makes visible one view into the application of practice on-the-ground. we make this visible with currencies. [^2]

each case-study therefore aims to utilise one or multiple [[practice currencies]].

these currencies are the verified measurements that form the foundation for data-backed storytelling. all the additional media - meeting recordings, photos, audio notes - are (qualitative) layers of additional context around this underlying (quantitative) heartbeat. 

the purpose of [[action-learning journeys]] having a lengthy alignment process is for the whole
