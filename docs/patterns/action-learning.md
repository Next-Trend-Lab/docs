prisma designs and [[Facilitation|facilitates]] multi-stakeholder [[action-learning journeys]], grounded in partner [[hubs|hubs]] in different [[bioregion|bioregions]]. Through our [[enrolment]] process, we onboard the following stakeholders into an alignment process lasting multiple weeks, culminating in an intensive:

1. [[hubs]]
2. [[practice networks]]
3. [[participants]]
4. [[partners]]

the core purpose of organising all these capacity-generating roles around an intensive is to create the conditions for a systemic intervention in which *[[practice]]* is *applied* on-the-ground. applying practice means embodying the principles by which the practice comes to life, generating experiential learning value. 

The product of each action-learning journey is a [[case-study]]. These case-studies are a multi-media, multi-perspective account of the experience, that serve the purpose of offering the learnings to a broader audience: action-learning, action-learning. The content of these case-studies is produced throughout the process through a kind of *participation-as-content-creation* practice:

1. meeting recordings
2. audio recordings
3. videos
4. learning exercises
5. documentation
6. various participation signals (more to come)

Whereas a case-study focusses on a single action-learning journey, this page speaks to action-learning as an underlying pattern repeating throughout all that we're working on. Prisma as a distributed participation platform requires the capability to organise action-learning intensives and communicate this from many perspectives.

In addition to generating the above learning material, which is occurring at the participation level, there is a second order of production aims, client-facing, which exists at three levels:

1. Features/ feature sets (e.g. functions/ apps)
2. Organisations/ organisational forms that support the ongoing development and application of practice (e.g. classes/ DAOs, startups)
3. Ecosystem shifts and pathways (namespaces/ e.g. an integrative co-design roadmap with multiple stakeholders and aligned partners at the landscape/ ecosystem level)

The core processes being worked on so far are:

1. [[enrolment]]
2. [[ground-potentialising|ground-potentialising]]
3. [[docs/Glossary/Enactment|enacting]]
4. [[a. Introduction|evaluating]]
5. [[processes/process-infrastructuring/overview|process-infrastructuring]]
