# A Regenerative Bioregional Incubator

Now, we position your startup as the culmination of this journeyâ€”a regenerative bioregional incubator that creates the space for communities to innovate and co-create systems aligned with ecological health and collective well-being.

**What We Do:**

- "Our incubator brings together technology partners, regenerative design communities, and local stakeholders to prototype new forms of human organizing. These innovation intensives take place in bioregional hubs, where the real-world conditions for systemic change are embedded."
- **Outcomes**: "Through these intensives, we co-create solutions that exist at three levels: new products and technologies, new organizational models, and regenerative bioregional ecosystems."
