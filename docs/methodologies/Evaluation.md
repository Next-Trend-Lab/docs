What is evaluation to you? What are the first notions that come to your head when you read this word?

Perhaps, you think about impact measurement. 

Or about performance reviews and KPIs.

Or about testing whether a desired outcome has been achieved, and how.

What is the essence of evaluation for you? 

**E-Valuation**

To us at Prisma, evaluation is a practice. Just like acting is, capacity-building is, writing is, and all other practices that make up any collective endeavour. 

What would the *verb in motion* be for evaluation, if you didn't think about it.

It would be *valuing*.

Evaluation, therefore, can be considered the act of 'valuing'. 

And the 'e'? It stands, as it does in science - for *energy*.

E-valuation is the practice of valuing energy flows. This is ultimately what any stakeholder is doing when they evaluate any effort that has been undertaken. They are considering the energy that has been put in, comparing the outcomes generated against what was desired, and conducting an analysis of the value generated.

**Purpose**

At prisma, our mission is to enabling collectives to undertake intentional action-learning journeys, imbue them with regenerative potential, and make visible the value generated therein for the evolution of multiple levels of stakeholders and orders of systems.

The purpose of evaluation then, is to assist this endeavor in three ways:
1. To enable the groups undertaking these journeys to be clear about what they are valuing
2. To provide tools that make visible the value being generated, and inform analyses and insights that enhance future group endeavors as well as the broader ecosystem of systems change experiments.
3. To enhance the ability of the group to grow as a system by weaving in insights from their own behavior into organizational and personal development
