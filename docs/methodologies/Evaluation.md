What is evaluation to you? What are the first notions that come to your head when you read this word?

Perhaps, you think about impact measurement. 

Or about performance reviews and KPIs.

Or about testing whether a desired outcome has been achieved, and how.

What is the essence of evaluation for you? 

**E-Valuation**

To us at Prisma, evaluation is a practice. Just like acting is, capacity-building is, writing is, and all other practices that make up any collective endeavour. 

What would the *verb in motion* be for evaluation, if you didn't think about it.

It would be *valuing*.

Evaluation, therefore, can be considered the act of 'valuing'. 

And the 'e'? It stands, as it does in science - for *energy*.

E-valuation is the practice of valuing energy flows. This is ultimately what any stakeholder is doing when they evaluate any effort that has been undertaken. They are considering the energy that has been put in, comparing the outcomes generated against what was desired, and conducting an analysis of the value generated.

**Purpose**

At prisma, our mission is to enabling collectives to undertake intentional action-learning journeys, imbue them with regenerative potential, and make visible the value generated therein for the evolution of multiple levels of stakeholders and orders of systems.

The purpose of evaluation then, is to assist this endeavor in three ways:
1. To enable the groups undertaking these journeys to be clear about **what they are valuing**
2. To provide tools that **make visible the value being generated**, and inform analyses and insights that enhance future group endeavors as well as the broader ecosystem of systems change experiments.
3. To enhance the ability of the group to **grow as a system** by weaving in insights from their own behavior into organizational and personal development

**Perspective**

As should be evident from the broader narrative of prisma, we are grounded in an **ethos of co-creation**. That is to say, we are vehemently opposed to the notion of prisma being seen as a parachuting service provider that is flown in by an organization to meet a need, deploys its machinery, derives the required results and leaves with little to no long-term programming in place.

Rather, we see our work as that of facilitators who work with the People, Place and Practice to concoct the ideal recipes for long term, systemic catalysis. 

As such, we hold the following perspectives towards evaluation:

1. **Co-creative**: What shall be evaluated (variables), how it will be measured (metrics), what level of growth is expected (standards) are all decided *in consensus with the community* - with processes tailored to match local decision-making practices and actively pulled towards greater self-organization.

2. **Multi-perspectival:** While we are stubborn about co-creation, we are also stubborn about ensuring a multi-capital lens to valuing flows of energy. Our approach is premised on *seeing, valuing and developing all forms of capital* - not just financial and economic.

3. **Developmental**: We see evaluation as an ongoing act, not just something that begins when the action is complete. Our tooling is designed to start valuing flows the moment they begin, even before the journey starts, and we are building our capacity to provide stakeholders with live signals and insights into value generation.

4. **Regenerative**: The direction of our evaluation methodology is towards seeing potential, rather than measuring effectiveness. We are looking for how (& why) different components of the system are growing, and not just temporary manifestations designed to meet short-term needs. *We are placing the capacity, potential and will of the people, the place and life itself at the center.*

**Methodology** 

Each of the above perspectives are operationalized via simple frameworks to construct a bricolage methodology and a general model for evaluation.
