With these methodologies, prisma designs and [[Facilitation|facilitates]] collaboration [[collaborative innovation intensives|intensives]], together with partner hubs in different [[bioregion|bioregions]]. This methodology aims to communicate the different parts of carrying out those processes. There are three underlying components:

1. Place/ bioregion
2. Action-learning journeys
3. Products

Within action-learning journeys, there is:

1. Systems of work
2. Levels of engagement (Teams)
3. [[enactment]] and [[developmental evaluation|evaluation]]

[[Products]] are functional capability developments, across the three levels of design complexity:

1. Features/ feature sets (ie apps)
2. Organisations/ organisational forms that support the ongoing development and application of practice (ie DAOs)
3. Ecosystems (ie integrative co-design with multiple stakeholder DAOs and aligned partners at the ecosystem level)

Methodologies being worked on so far are:

1. [[value-system design methodology]] for evaluation
2. [[incubation methodology]] for enactment and products
3. [[process infrastructuring]] for
	1. [[enrolment]]
	2. [[potentialise|potentialising]]
	3. [[enactment|enacting]]
	4. [[developmental evaluation|evaluating]]
