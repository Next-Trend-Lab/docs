the purpose of this page is to communicate how the capabilities being developed by prisma - work in service to evolving communities of practice, such as Regenesis [^1] practice of regenerative development and design. at the core of our methodologies are the dynamic interplays between the forward movement of [[enactment]] and the ongoing, reflective and integrative movement of [[Developmental Evaluation|evaluation]]. a key product, found at the end of the page, is a kind of roadmap, made up of interim states working toward an end-state, including images for each. this page is guided by the aim of highlighting the alignment with the regenesis story of place program, in terms of literal transposition of organisation capabilities onto process.

prisma is a process design collective that facilitates [[Place-Source|place-sourced]] [[Collaborative Innovation Intensives|collaborative innovation intensives]]. innovation intensives are a period of rapid innovation guided by a ([[nested?]]) facilitator team that has been co-designing with the [[transformation|communities of place]] for 8 months - each event requiring 8 months of intention development, co-design, alignment and systems onboarding. In order for there to be the capabilities needed to deliver x18 intensives in the first three years, starting with a team of 5-6 core contributors, working part-time at most until sufficient financing covering a [[fair pay]] for all is unlocked, we need to...

design a [[Holochain|minimum viable governance system]] to work with two streams of financial capital flows...

1. External capability development: assuring code and project quality whilst maintaining alignment with place-unique (digital) expressions of developmental inquiries into the essence of place. [^2]
1. Internal capability development: working on the underlying patterns that generate the capacities needed for the development, application and evaluation of [[prisma methodologies]]

both streams of financial capital flows are being circulated in service to making visible the multiple forms of value creation and exchange present in the thriving of regenerative communities. as such, these events, developed in partnership with regional hubs and their [[communities of place]], aim to be a catalytic agent in the self-expression of place-sourced practices being developed and applied in alignment with increasing orders of bioregional wealth.

this governance systems aims to multiply the capacity of the facilitator team by creating the conditions that enable...

1. [[enrolment|self-organisation]] across each event instance, as well as
1. stewardship of the alignment between the place-sourced products of the intensives and the potential of the non-local community of practice the intensives are being organised for (i.e. [[resourcing]]).

the following core facilitation team is forming to bring that governance system and its capacity-multiplying capabilities into being:

- [[Delfina Terrado]]: [[enactment|enacting]], [[experience design]], [[incubation methodology]], [[practice-based daos]]
- [[Shikhar Agarwal]]: [[Developmental Evaluation|evaluating]], [[value-system design methodology]], [[Holochain|place-sourced currency design]]
- [[Mercy Fordwoo]]: [[potentialise|potentialising]], [[hub networking]]
- [[Ryah Chandler]]: [[enrolment]]
- [[Noah]]: [[potentialise|potentialising]], essentially a project board
- [[Tobias Fechner]]: [[process infrastructuring]]

at the highest level, each event exists at the following four stages, sometimes multiple simultaneously. these stages each receive a sub-domain dedicated to engaging a wider audience with the inner workings of the [[communities of place]], at that given stage. these sub-domains become the endpoints by which each hub can integrate their place-unique expressions of working with the essence of place in a global-scale, self-evolving platform. see [[intensive stages and place-specific endpoints]].

1. [[enrolment]] (e.g. enrolment.wilderness-centre.co.uk from Paul's work [here](https://www.wilderness-centre.co.uk/))
1. [[potentialise|potentialising]] (e.g. potentialising.regenex.us from Max's work [here](https://regenex.us/ramboland))
1. [[enactment|enacting]] (e.g. enacting.resilience.earth from Oscar's work [here](https://resilience.earth/))
1. [[Developmental Evaluation|evaluating]] (e.g. evaluating.atreyu.global from Ebru's work [here](https://atreyu.global/))

we will aim to automate the registering and configuring of sub-domains, minimum viable service/ api deployments and testing, and porting back into a global visibility mapping interface. these endpoints are the means for communicating activity on-the-ground and the stem for each event-specific code repository.

event capacities are sourced from at least the following four stakeholder groups:

1. [[participants]]
1. [[communities of place]]
1. [[communities of practice]]
1. [[partners]]

these [stakeholder development pathways](https://register.prisma.events) are being designed to XXX

the [[process infrastructuring]] developed to support the organisation of each event instance is also designed to be configurable and self-contained, able to be deployed to a server/ [[Holochain|device]] network local to the [[communities of place]] hosting the event. the purpose of this is to align with the aim of building capacity in-place for ongoing development of the products incubated during the intensive. at least in terms of the context of regenesis community of practice, these products are in service to...

instruments supporting this process design are:

- [[publishing engine]]
- [[Core Facilitator Capacity|patterns for facilitator teams]]
- [[DID System]]
- A financing distribution methodology and tooling, both internal and external. See [[capital distribution]].
- Organisational agreements making serving [[incubation methodology|intensives as incubation processes]]
- [[speech-to-currency]] serving place-unique [[practice-based daos]]

[^2]: The creative tension of glocal: visibility and verification of local network effect at global-scale levels of capital distribution. mediating multiple forms of evaluation and communicating success cases of application of practice. global systemic crises (are [[complex systems]] and) require vast amounts of thinking processing in order to respond collectively and regeneratively. evolving systems at those scales whilst at the same time in alignment with the continuity of life on earth requires place-specific practices. practice has the role of developing ecological literacy (seeing patterns in nature).
