The term **enactment** refers to the **active, lived processes** through which systems, knowledge, and ways of organizing emerge. Rooted in **embodied cognition** and **systems thinking**, enactment emphasizes that systems are **brought into being through interaction**—they don't pre-exist as static entities but arise through the collective [[practice|practices]] of their participants. This idea is inspired by theorists like **Evan Thompson**, **Francisco Varela**, and the principle of **autopoiesis**, which highlights the self-organizing and self-sustaining nature of living systems.

In our methodology, enactment describes how **new social structures**—such as governance models or economic systems—are co-created by the actions, relationships, and innovations of participants in collaborative spaces. For example, the **civic infrastructures** we help develop are not imposed from the outside but are **enacted** through **self-organizing practices**, such as experimenting with governance frameworks like **sociocracy** or developing **Web3-based currencies**. These new systems emerge dynamically, shaped by the interactions and feedback loops among participants, aligning with the broader principles of **living systems**.

By focusing on enactment, we emphasize the role of **[[practice|practice-based]] approaches** in systems change, where the collective engagement of people **co-creates the conditions** for new societal infrastructures to emerge. Through this lens, [[a. Introduction|evaluation]] becomes essential to make sense of the value generated by these processes, balancing innovation with reflection.

# Questions and Reflections Raised by Enactment

How are we creating the system as we engage with it?
- Enactment challenges participants and facilitators to reflect on how their practices are actively shaping the system they are part of. It invites awareness of the participatory and relational nature of systems change.

How do we cultivate the conditions for the emergence of new systems?
- Enactment requires creating an environment where new [[Practice|practices]] can be safely explored, embodied, and iterated upon. What are the practices, tools, and relationships that foster this kind of innovation?

How do we balance enactment with reflection and [[a. Introduction|evaluation]]?
- While enactment involves activating new ways of being, evaluation (particularly developmental evaluation) ensures that we are learning from the process and understanding the value of what is emerging. How can we create feedback loops that allow for both action and sense-making?

How do we create a safe space for participants to explore new ways of being and organizing?
- What mechanisms will encourage vulnerability and openness among participants?

Which innovative methodologies (sociocracy, holacracy, teal organization) will we implement, and how will we adapt them to our context?
- How will we ensure participants understand these concepts before implementation?

What are the desired outcomes for each enactment session, and how will we measure their success?
- How will we define and assess the effectiveness of each methodology applied?
