## **Living Systems Principles: The Compass for Regeneration**

_Drawing wisdom from nature to guide our path._

In the heart of every regenerative initiative lies a profound truth: that the universe is not a machine to be mastered but a living system to be understood. At Prisma, we turn to Living Systems Principles as our guiding compass, recognizing that the wisdom of nature holds the key to creating a more just, sustainable, and thriving world.

These principles are not just abstract conceptsâ€”they are practical guidelines for action, offering a framework for designing systems, building communities, and stewarding resources in ways that honor the interconnectedness of all life. By learning to see the world through the lens of living systems, we can move beyond mere sustainability to actively regenerate the health and vitality of our planet.

## What are Living Systems Principles?

Living Systems Principles (LSP) describe the underlying patterns and processes that enable life to thrive. Drawn from the fields of ecology, biology, and systems thinking, they offer a holistic framework for understanding how living organisms organize, adapt, and evolve.

1. **Interdependence:** Every element in a living system is connected, with relationships driving resilience.
    

_Application at Prisma:_ Promotes understanding, especially in communities of practice and its team.

1. **Cycles:** Resources are used, renewed and integrated in this phase.
    

_Application at Prisma:_ Promotes frameworks to understand and build on circular economies.

1. **Self-Organisation**: Capacity is distributed and autonomy allows change to come in waves.
    

_Application at Prisma:_ With its open-source nature, the Holochain application allows the community to govern themselves, and be a part of the movement.

1. **Diversity**: Promotes an improvement in resilience and creativity.
    

_Application at Prisma:_ The team has to account for all participants of the community, ensuring equal levels of trust in any activity that they work on.

1. **Evolution:** The ongoing ability to learn, shift, grow and adapt based on new experiences.
    

_Application at Prisma:_ This is seen best in the action-based learning journeys, where learnings that are both new and old can create value.  
1. **Fractals**: Each individual can reflect on the structure and patterns of everything around.

_Application at Prisma:_ Communities have their structure copied in all actions.

By understanding their actions, especially in context with all listed systems, the team can make sure that actions and interactions are the most efficient.

## Weaving Principles into Practice

Within Prisma, this framework is implemented in key ways, including:

*The e-valuation framework, where an alignment with SDG goals as well as living systems principles is key in developing metrics.

*Holochain DAO, where processes are developed and improved upon.

## An example

Let's say there's an action learning process designed to regenerate food. By using Holochain to create a decentralized community, that can create new innovations. It's self-sustaining, it has diversity, and it gives back as much as it takes. It is by working like this that we come back to earth and do what it has to do.

## What's Next?

We are at the start. As time goes by, the earth's health gets worse, and our call to create a new world has to go on.
