## **Multi-Capitals Framework: Seeing the Full Spectrum of Value**

_Beyond the bottom line: a compass for regenerative evaluation._

In a world often measured in dollars and cents, it's easy to overlook the wealth that truly sustains us—the health of our ecosystems, the strength of our communities, the richness of our cultural heritage. At Prisma, we recognize that true regeneration requires a broader lens—one that encompasses the full spectrum of capital that contributes to thriving systems.

That’s why we embrace the Multi-Capitals Framework (MCF), a powerful tool for understanding and evaluating the diverse forms of value that flow through our [[action-learning journeys]] and [[communities of place]].

## The Framework

The Multi-Capitals Framework is an accounting system that helps organizations understand how they are not only impacting profit, but also, people and the planet.  
What are the forms of capital used or impacted?  
How are they used?  
What is the organization doing to not only sustain the capitals, but enhance them?  
For a team just starting off, this looks like determining which capitals are going to be the focus and then developing ways to improve and grow those metrics.

The types of Capitals identified are the following:

1. Financial Capital, which can be measured by the company's overall profit and loss, and what they can then give back to stakeholders.
    
2. Manufactured Capital can be measured by the infrastructure that the company has helped to build, such as buildings, tools, and machines.
    
3. Intellectual Capital, which is patents and other intangible assets the company has, or can make as a result of its operations.
    
4. Human Capital, which is the skill and overall competence of the human resources, as they come together to grow this organization.
    
5. Social Capital, the ways that the operations help to bring positive change to its members (including trust, common values, and relations)
    
6. Natural Capital, the ways that actions and outputs create improvements to environmental resources.
    

## 1. Natural Capital

_Ecosystems, biodiversity, air quality, water resources, soil health…_

This isn’t just “environmental impact”—it’s the foundation of all other capitals, the life-support system that sustains us all.

_Evaluation Questions:_ Are we enhancing the health and resilience of ecosystems in this place? Are we reducing our carbon footprint and minimizing pollution? Are we protecting and restoring biodiversity?

_Example Metrics:_  
*Tons of CO2 sequestered  
*Acres of habitat restored  
*Improved water quality indicators

## 2. Social Capital

_Relationships, trust, collaboration, equity, justice, community cohesion…_

A thriving society depends on strong social bonds, where all have fair and impartial access to resources.

_Evaluation Questions:_ Are we strengthening relationships within and between communities? Are we fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose? Are we promoting equity and justice?

_Example Metrics:_  
*Increased community participation rates  
*Improved trust indices  
*Reduced crime rates  
*Equitable access to education, healthcare, and other essential services

## 3. Human Capital

_Skills, knowledge, health, well-being, education, leadership…_

A healthy society relies on the skills, knowledge, health, and well-being of its people.

_Example Metrics:_  
*Improved graduation rates and test scores  
*Increased access to healthcare and preventative services  
*Growth in leadership roles

## 4. Manufactured Capital

_Buildings, equipment, infrastructure, technology…_

The physical and technological systems that support our lives, ensuring the resources needed for all.

_Evaluation Questions:_ Are we building resilient and sustainable infrastructure? Are we using technology to improve efficiency and equity? Are we promoting innovation and creativity?

_Example Metrics:_  
*Improved energy efficiency in buildings  
*Increased access to renewable energy sources  
*Greater connectivity and digital literacy  
*Reliable and affordable public transportation

## 5. Financial Capital

_Money, investments, savings, economic stability, financial literacy…_

The economic resources that enable us to meet our needs and build for the future—when it is in alignment with social and environmental goals.

_Evaluation Questions:_ Are we promoting financial literacy and economic stability? Are we investing in regenerative and equitable business models? Are we creating a financial system that serves people and the planet?

_Example Metrics:_  
*Household financial stability and security

## 6. Intellectual Capital

_Knowledge, innovation, creativity, cultural heritage…_

The wisdom, creativity, and cultural traditions that shape our identity and guide our actions.

_Evaluation Questions:_ Are we preserving and celebrating our cultural heritage? Are we fostering innovation and creativity? Are we promoting knowledge sharing and lifelong learning?

_Example Metrics:_

- Increased access to arts and cultural programs.
    

## 7. Political Capital

_Accountability, decision-making transparency, power dynamics_

How a leader can ensure that they are in touch with the world as a whole, that they can make fair, reliable, and respectful change.

_Evaluation Questions:_ Are our leaders respectful? Are they open to change? Do the members have a real voice in the governance?

_Example Metrics:_

- Transparent leadership with members that are accountable for the change as its happening,
    
- The members feel involved and heard.
    

## 8. Spiritual Capital

_Intangible values, beliefs, and sense of purpose that guide individuals and communities_

Does everyone feel supported? Are their voices important? Do all voices matter? This speaks to the individual member as a whole.

_Evaluation Questions:_ Does leadership listen? Can they respond to the needs of everyone? Is this an ecosystem to join, not to escape from?

_Example Metrics:_

- The community feels strong.
    

## In Action

Each of these will be impacted by how the actions are felt, and all must be viewed as a lens to improve the systems.

## Our Intention

How these capitals interact with each other is the very thing that we plan to follow, to observe, to ensure is as safe as the world in which we find ourselves.  
This is a way to improve our processes - and to leave things better than we found them.
