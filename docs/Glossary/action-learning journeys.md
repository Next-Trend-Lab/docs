Action-learning journeys serve as the container by which communities aim to periodically embody alternative futures. Through several weeks of onboarding and alignment leading up to the event, cohorts of participants organise themselves in ways that demonstrate new capabilities for a given system to be able to express itself. 

The [[Replace Academy Case Study]] is an example from a previous action-learning journey, which created the [[aspect]] of knowledge commoning.

An action-learning journey is...

- In-person
- Multiple weeks
- Collaborative
- Intense
- Experimental
- Organised by a group of people that identify with their bioregion 
- In service to catalysing a [[state-change]] in a given system of the regional context, made visible by their [[aspect]]
- a journey of [[action-learning]]
