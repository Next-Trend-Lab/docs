Action-learning journeys serve as the container by which communities aim to periodically embody alternative futures. Through several weeks of onboarding and alignment leading up to the event, cohorts of participants organise themselves in ways that demonstrate new capabilities for the expression of given system. 

Here's an example from a previous action-learning journey: [[Replace Academy Case Study]].

An action-learning journey is...
- In-person
- Multiple weeks
- Collaborative
- Intense
- Organised by a group of people that identify with their bioregion 
- In service to catalysing a [[state-change]] in a given system of the regional context, made visible by their [[aspect]]

Each action-learning journey is made up of...

1. **SYSTEMS:** systems of place and systems of endeavour/ intervention, such as
	- knowledge commoning
	- villaging systems
	- land-relations (and what is distastefully known as property)
	- food systems, and more...
2. **PRACTICE:** application and learning, or, [[enactment]] and [[developmental evaluation|evaluation]]
3. **COMMUNITY:** [[communities of practice]] and [[communities of place]]
