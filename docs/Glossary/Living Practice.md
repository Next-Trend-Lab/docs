## **What is a Living Practice?**

_More than methodology, less than religion_

In a world hungry for definitive answers, for rigid frameworks and scalable solutions, the concept of a living practice may seem elusive, even paradoxical. Isn’t a “practice” something you perfect, standardize, and then replicate? Isn’t “living” something unpredictable, messy, and resistant to control?

And yet, it is precisely in this tension between structure and flow that true vitality resides. For Prisma, a living practice isn't a fixed methodology nor a dogmatic code of conduct. It is a continuously evolving system of action, reflection, and adaptation, one that embraces emergence, celebrates experimentation, and honors the interconnectedness of all things.

## **Beyond Technique: Cultivating Relationship**

To understand what a living practice _is_, it’s helpful to clarify what it _isn’t_. It isn't:

- **A Scripted Performance:** Not a rigid set of steps to be followed mechanically, but a responsive dance with the unique context at hand.
    
- **A Solitary Pursuit:** Not a lone wolf endeavor, but a collaborative journey shaped by shared values, mutual support, and reciprocal learning.
    
- **A Fixed Destination:** Not a quest for a predetermined outcome, but an exploration of emergent possibilities, guided by a commitment to regenerative outcomes.
    

Instead, a living practice is rooted in a deep relationship – with oneself, with the community, with the land. It involves:

- **Tuning In**: Opening to the sensory information with the ecosystem or community, including data, the land and the people's feedback.
    
- **Experimenting**: Exploring new possibilities based on new experiences and challenges, through learning.
    
- **Adapting**: Learning about the new context, based on the challenges.
    
- **Iterating**: Working to improve at a fundamental level as the context and needs of the world grows and changes around us.
    

## **The Essence of Aliveness**

What makes a practice “living” is its capacity to adapt, to evolve, to resonate with the dynamic rhythms of life. Like a healthy ecosystem, it thrives on diversity, embraces feedback, and continuously regenerates itself through cycles of growth, decay, and renewal.

It draws inspiration from living systems:

- **Mycelial Networks**: Fungal connections that are distributed and share resources.
    
- **Bird Migrations**: Patterns that support the evolution, change and growth.
    
- **Forest Successions**: The species make way for ecosystems to mirror the incubation methodologies.
    

## What's Next

Moving from a concept to a process that we know and use is no easy task, but we can get there together.
