_Weaving intention, knowledge, and presence to guide transformative journeys._

In the realm of regenerative systems change, facilitators are more than just event managers—they are stewards of transformation, weavers of connection, and catalysts for collective wisdom. At Prisma, we recognize that the capacity of our facilitator teams is essential for creating [[Action-learning journeys]] that are both impactful and deeply attuned to the essence of place. This page explores the core competencies, skills, and qualities that define effective facilitation within our unique context.

## **Beyond Traditional Facilitation: A Regenerative Lens**

Traditional facilitation often focuses on achieving predetermined outcomes through structured processes. While these skills remain valuable, our approach requires something more: a capacity to navigate complexity, embrace emergence, and honor the inherent wisdom of living systems.

## **The Key Capacities**

Drawing from the document as well as other literature and research, here are key capabilities that guide our work in facilitating change:

1. **Enactment:** The ability to embody new processes and enact events is a strength. They guide participants to explore the potential of each place with a sense of embodied presence.
    
2. **Potentializing:** Through potentializing, our facilitators develop the image, articulation, and communication of each process that reflects and reinforces a common bond with the people.
    
3. **Developmental Evaluation:** We rely on our facilitators to provide an ongoing evaluation that enables and promotes adaptive strategies that track the patterns as they emerge.
    
4. **Embracing the Spirit of Emergence:** The ability to facilitate processes where outcomes are not predetermined but emerge from the interplay of diverse perspectives, local conditions, and unexpected synergies.
    
5. **Listening to Life:** The ability to listen deeply to what communities, systems, and the land itself, have to say, honouring multiple ways of knowing (including Indigenous wisdom, scientific knowledge, and intuitive insights).
    
6. **Cultivating Relationships:** Facilitators have to ensure that trust is established with people within their bioregion.
    
7. **Weaving Stories:** Facilitators are tasked to turn metrics into culturally-relevant narratives, they can breathe life into every corner of the process, and to make the data meaningful.
    
8. **Creating Safe Space**: Facilitators must foster safe and inclusive spaces, celebrating a culture of mutual respect in a world that’s often divisive.
    

## **The Five Facets**

1. **Embracing Complexity:** Each of the listed team members should be ready and able to operate in spaces that are complex.
    
2. **Holistic Thinking**: The team has to view problems and come up with regenerative solutions that are outside of just 1 or 2 verticals - as is often the case in the world.
    
3. **Ethical Guidance** All choices and courses have to be viewed in their best sense for all participants.
    
4. **Facilitating Reflection**: Each of the team members are actively involved in asking questions, in helping each other to grow and adapt, in helping to be mindful of the world at hand.
    
5. **Enabling Autonomy**: The team is there to oversee and support each other as equals.
    

## **Key Roles**

Our teams play many integral roles in an action-learning journey.

1. The enaction and development skills, the practice-based DAO and everything it brings, are critical in the work we are trying to accomplish for the world.
    
2. The processes enable self-organizing, and helps those to better govern themselves over time.
    
3. Through evaluation, the facilitation team helps the organizations align themselves in their goals.
    

## **Our call**

Our call is for a team is is regenerative, for a team that is ready to change. As the space continues to improve, it will grow with the wisdom of those who work in it, for it, and with it.
