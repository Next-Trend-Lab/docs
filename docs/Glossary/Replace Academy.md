# An Action-Learning Case Study
Lasting 17 days, 15 participants joined a co-living space in North-West Wales, practicing self-organising at the scale of a single household. The theme of this action-learning journey was Knowledge Commoning, which aimed to grow the perspective on how communities gather, store and evolve what and how they know. 

An enlivened space of creative potential, the group practiced sociocracy, forming circles, twice, daily, to hear each others' experience of the experiment in self-organising and make decisions, collectively.

The product discovered and incubated during the journey was a semantic web crawler that complemented a 12-stage knowledge commons framework. The two parts worked together to form the foundation for a multi-perspectival knowledge commons. Local organisations guided the direction of the process from day 1, and by the end of the 17 days a multi-stakeholder guild had formed with will to continue the initiative further, applying the tooling in the local context.
