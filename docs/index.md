# prisma

prisma is a [[process design collective]] that facilitates [[collaborative innovation intensives]] to [[place-source]] public goods infrastructure development so that [[bioregion|bioregional]] communities can participate more fully in pathways toward their [[life-affirming futures]].

We work at three levels:

1. **PRODUCTS:** To develop technology products for clients from a living systems paradigm.
1. **ORGANISATIONS:** To incubate teams as instruments in creating the conditions for participating in systems evolution.
1. **ECOSYSTEMS:** To catalyse venture development ecosystems in partner bioregions to build public goods infrastructures.
