_Listening to the interconnected flows of life through a systemic lens._

## **Introduction: A Holistic Framework for Regeneration**

In the work of regenerative systems change, evaluation is not simply a process of measurement—it is an act of listening, of attuning ourselves to the subtle flows of energy and value that sustain life. The **Five Spheres of Evaluation** provide a holistic framework for understanding these flows, allowing us to honor the complexity of systems while grounding our work in actionable insights.

This framework resonates deeply with the principles of **Radical Ecological Democracy (RED)**, as articulated by Ashish Kothari and others. At its core, RED calls for a world where ecological sustainability, social equity, cultural diversity, and grassroots democracy are interwoven into the fabric of decision-making. Similarly, the Five Spheres invite us to evaluate not just outcomes but the relationships and dynamics that shape our collective futures.

## **The Five Spheres: A Living System**

Each sphere represents a dimension of systemic health and vitality. Together, they form an interconnected web that mirrors the nested wholes of life itself—individuals within communities, communities within ecosystems, ecosystems within bioregions.

## 1. Ecological Sphere: The Breath of the Earth

The ecological sphere focuses on the health and resilience of natural systems—soils, watersheds, forests, and biodiversity. It asks: _How are our actions restoring or depleting the life-support systems we depend on?_

- **Inspired by RED:** Kothari’s emphasis on ecological sustainability aligns with this sphere’s call to prioritize harmony with nature over extractive practices.
    
- **Example Metric:** Biodiversity restoration in mangrove ecosystems during an [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]] in Accra.
    
- **Prompt:** “How did your actions today contribute to the health of your local environment?”
    

## 2. Social Sphere: The Ties That Bind Us

The social sphere examines relationships, networks, trust, and social cohesion within communities. It asks: _How are we fostering connection and mutual support among people?_

- **Inspired by RED:** Radical democracy requires strong social bonds where decision-making is participatory and inclusive—a principle embodied in this sphere.
    
- **Example Metric:** Trust-building scores among participants in a waste-to-energy initiative in Accra.
    
- **Prompt:** “What strengthened trust within your group today?”
    

## 3. Cultural Sphere: The Stories We Tell Ourselves

The cultural sphere explores shared values, traditions, knowledge systems, and practices that shape how communities relate to one another and to their environment. It asks: _How are we honoring and evolving the cultural narratives that sustain us?_

- **Inspired by RED:** Kothari highlights cultural diversity as a cornerstone of ecological democracy; this sphere ensures that regeneration is rooted in place-based wisdom.
    
- **Example Metric:** Preservation of traditional crafts through recycled material initiatives in Accra’s [[living lab]].
    
- **Prompt:** “What cultural values guided your choices today?”
    

## 4. Political Sphere: The Flow of Power

The political sphere evaluates governance structures, decision-making processes, and accountability mechanisms. It asks: _How are we redistributing power to enable equitable participation?_

- **Inspired by RED:** Decentralized governance is central to RED’s vision; this sphere tracks how power flows within regenerative systems.
    
- **Example Metric:** Participation rates in DAO-based voting for resource allocation during an [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]].
    
- **Prompt:** “How did you participate in governance decisions today?”
    

## 5. Economic Sphere: The Alchemy of Resources

The economic sphere focuses on resource allocation, financial flows, and livelihoods. It asks: _How are we creating systems that generate shared abundance rather than scarcity?_

- **Inspired by RED:** Kothari critiques growth-oriented economies; this sphere aligns with his call for localized economies rooted in sufficiency and equity.
    
- **Example Metric:** Circulation of local currencies within regenerative microbusinesses during the Accra ALJ.
    
- **Prompt:** “How did you contribute to the economic well-being of your group today?”
    

## **Interconnections Between Spheres**

These spheres do not exist in isolation—they are deeply interdependent. For example:

- A thriving mangrove forest (**ecological**) strengthens community resilience (**social**) while preserving traditional fishing practices (**cultural**).
    
- Transparent governance (**political**) enables equitable resource distribution (**economic**) while fostering trust (**social**).
    

In Radical Ecological Democracy, these interconnections reflect what Kothari calls “nested circles” of sustainability—where local actions ripple outward to influence larger systems.

## **Practical Applications: The Accra ALJ Example**

During the Accra [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]], the Five Spheres were used as a lens for evaluation:

1. **Ecological Sphere:** Mangrove restoration metrics tracked through IoT sensors revealed improvements in biodiversity and carbon sequestration.
    
2. **Social Sphere:** Trust indices showed increased collaboration between youth leaders and elders during recycling initiatives.
    
3. **Cultural Sphere:** Traditional Adinkra symbols were incorporated into recycled art projects, revitalizing cultural pride.
    
4. **Political Sphere:** DAO voting enabled equitable allocation of funds for community-led projects.
    
5. **Economic Sphere:** Local microbusinesses flourished as recycled materials were turned into marketable products.
    

This holistic approach ensured that every intervention was evaluated not just for its immediate outcomes but for its broader systemic impacts.

## **Why This Matters**

In a world facing ecological collapse and social fragmentation, frameworks like the Five Spheres offer a way forward—one that honors complexity while grounding us in actionable insights. By integrating Ashish Kothari’s principles of Radical Ecological Democracy with our evaluation methodology, we create tools that not only measure impact but also guide us toward regenerative futures.

This is more than evaluation—it is storytelling at the scale of life itself.
