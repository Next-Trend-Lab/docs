## **Evaluation Methodology**

_Valuing invisible flows to illuminate systemic transformation._

## **Introduction: The Essence of Evaluation**

Evaluation, for us, is not a mechanical exercise of tallying outputs or measuring linear progress. It is a [[practice]] of listening deeply to the energy flows within and across systems‚Äîecological, social, cultural, political, and economic. It is how collectives learn to adapt, evolve, and thrive in harmony with the essence of place.

At Prisma, evaluation is the essence of governance. It is how communities learn about their attempts to self-organize toward shared regenerative goals. By valuing energy flows‚Äîboth tangible and intangible‚Äîwe create pathways for collective learning, adaptation, and transformation.

Our methodology is rooted in the [[Multi-Capitals Framework]], which serves as a lens to tag, analyze, and interpret data across individual, group, and systemic levels. It honors complexity while providing actionable insights that guide regenerative intervention design and enhance collective intelligence.

## **The Multi-Capitals Framework: A Foundation for Understanding**

The multi-capitals framework identifies eight forms of capital that flow through individuals, groups, and systems. These capitals are not isolated; they interact dynamically to shape the health and vitality of living systems.

## **Natural Capital**

Ecological assets such as ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources.

- _Prompt Example:_ ‚ÄúHow did your actions today support your local environment?‚Äù
    
- _Metric:_ Soil health improvement linked to community-led restoration efforts.
    

## **Social Capital**

Relationships, networks, trust, and social cohesion.

- _Prompt Example:_ ‚ÄúWhat strengthened trust within your group today?‚Äù
    
- _Metric:_ Collaboration effectiveness scores tied to trust-building activities.
    

## **Cultural Capital**

Shared values, traditions, knowledge systems, and cultural practices.

- _Prompt Example:_ ‚ÄúWhat cultural values guided your choices today?‚Äù
    
- _Metric:_ Preservation of oral histories through community storytelling workshops.
    

## **Human Capital**

Skills, knowledge, emotional intelligence, and personal development.

- _Prompt Example:_ ‚ÄúWhat new skills or insights did you gain today?‚Äù
    
- _Metric:_ Emotional resilience trends reflected in journaling sentiment analysis.
    

## **Economic Capital**

Financial resources and economic assets.

- _Prompt Example:_ ‚ÄúHow did you contribute to the economic well-being of your group?‚Äù
    
- _Metric:_ Local currency circulation within regenerative microbusinesses.
    

## **Built Capital**

Physical infrastructure such as buildings, tools, and technology.

- _Prompt Example:_ ‚ÄúHow did physical assets support your activities today?‚Äù
    
- _Metric:_ Utilization rates of shared community spaces during interventions.
    

## **Political Capital**

Influence within decision-making processes and governance structures.

- _Prompt Example:_ ‚ÄúHow did you participate in governance decisions today?‚Äù
    
- _Metric:_ Civic participation rates linked to DAO voting mechanisms.
    

## **Spiritual Capital**

Intangible values, beliefs, and sense of purpose that guide individuals and communities.

- _Prompt Example:_ ‚ÄúWhat inspired you today to act in service of something greater than yourself?‚Äù
    
- _Metric:_ Alignment with regenerative principles reflected in participant reflections.
    

## **Analytical Layers: From Flows to Reflection**

## **Layer 1: Flows of Capital (Primary Layer)**

Each journaling entry is tagged based on its alignment with one or more forms of capital. AI-driven NLP models identify keywords and patterns that indicate flows (e.g., references to collaboration ‚Üí social capital; reflections on biodiversity ‚Üí natural capital).

## **Layer 2: Dimensions of Analysis**

After tagging entries by flows of capital, data is analyzed across key dimensions:

1. **Emotional/Sentimental:** Emotional tone tied to capital flows (e.g., positive sentiment when contributing to natural capital).
    
2. **Logical/Productive:** Effectiveness of actions in generating or sustaining specific capitals.
    
3. **Emergent/Novel:** Unusual patterns in how capitals interact or are generated (e.g., unexpected synergies between cultural and economic capital).
    

## **Layer 3: Stakeholder Levels**

Flows of capital are evaluated across stakeholder levels:

1. **Individual Level:** How individuals generate or engage with specific capitals (e.g., skill-building ‚Üí human capital).
    
2. **Group Level:** Collaborative generation of capitals within teams (e.g., trust-building ‚Üí social capital).
    
3. **Systemic Level:** Broader systemic impacts resulting from aggregated flows (e.g., ecological restoration ‚Üí natural capital).
    

## **Layer 4: Intra-Individual Reflection**

At the deepest layer, journaling data reflects intra-individual growth:

1. Personal alignment with regenerative principles.
    
2. Emotional resilience trends over time.
    
3. Developmental progress based on recurring themes in journaling entries.
    

## **Tagging & Analysis Workflow**

1. **Data Collection:** Inputs include journaling entries (text/voice), facilitator-triggered prompts, metadata (time/place), and contextual observations.
    
2. **Multi-Capitals Tagging:** AI models tag each entry based on keywords/themes aligned with forms of capital.
    
3. **Dimensional Analysis:** Sentiment analysis evaluates emotional tone tied to each form of capital; emergent patterns are flagged for further exploration.
    
4. **Stakeholder-Level Aggregation:** Individual-level insights are aggregated into group-level metrics; group-level insights feed into systemic metrics.
    
5. **Intra-Individual Feedback:** Personalized insights are delivered to users based on their journaling data.
    

## **Use Case: Accra ALJ**

During the Accra [[action-learning journey]]:

1. Participants journal about their experiences collaborating on waste diversion initiatives.
    
2. Entries are tagged as contributing to social (trust-building), natural (biodiversity restoration), and economic (microbusiness development) capitals.
    
3. Sentiment analysis reveals a surge in positive emotional tone after a community storytelling session.
    
4. Insights are delivered:
    
    - To participants: "Your reflections show strong contributions to social capital through collaboration."
        
    - To facilitators: "Group dynamics indicate high levels of trust-building."
        

## **Why This Matters**

Our evaluation methodology doesn‚Äôt just measure outcomes‚Äîit makes invisible flows visible. By tracking energy exchanges across multiple layers‚Äîfrom systemic impacts down to individual reflections‚Äîwe create a holistic understanding of change that honors complexity while enabling action.

Capital isn‚Äôt just financial; it‚Äôs relational, ecological, cultural‚Äîit‚Äôs everything that nourishes life‚Äôs interconnected web.
