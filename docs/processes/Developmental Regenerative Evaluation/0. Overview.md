What is evaluation?

Below are some of the concepts that your mind might evoke in response:

- impact measurement. 
- performance reviews and KPIs.
- gauging the efficiency of processes.

What is common across these? What is the essence of evaluation?

As the term suggests, it is about ***finding the value in what is being // has been done***. 

**E-Valuation**

Evaluation is a [[practice]]. Just like enacting is, capacity-building is, documentation is, and all other iterative, evolutionary actions are that make up any collective endeavor.

For any collective that is trying to work on something together, or any system that has emerged in response to fulfilling a need, evaluation is that practice which enables it to learn. For, in finding that which is of value, it is able to better able to shape its own growth towards the directions that are most suitable for its unique evolutionary trajectory.

The *verb* for evaluation is *valuing*.

Evaluation, therefore, can be considered the **practice of valuing.** Unlike conventional approaches where value is very rigidly bestowed upon objects such as money or goals achieved and activities that relate to these outcomes, we see evaluation as the repetitive practice of valuing that which serves the collective most in the given context.

And the 'e'? Regardless of the etymology, perhaps it stands, as it does in science - for *energy*.

> E-valuation is the practice of iteratively valuing flows of energy. 

This is ultimately what any stakeholder is doing when they evaluate any effort that has been undertaken. They are considering the energy that has been put in, comparing the outcomes generated against what was desired, and conducting an analysis of the value generated.

We are building evaluation tooling and methodology that shows the truth of what genuinely contributes to the progress or success of any project, especially those in the uncharted spaces of regenerative systems change.

**Why Evaluation**

At prisma, our mission is to enabling collectives to undertake intentional [[action-learning journeys]], imbue them with regenerative potential, and make visible the value generated therein for the evolution of multiple levels of stakeholders and orders of systems.

The purpose of evaluation then, is to assist this endeavor in three ways:

1. To enable the collectives undertaking these journeys to be clear about **what they are inherently valuing** through their actions, learning and processing.
2. To provide tools that **make visible the value being generated**, and inform analyses and insights that enhance future group endeavors as well as the broader ecosystem of systems change experiments.
3. To enhance the ability of the collective to **grow as a system** by weaving in insights from their own behavior into organizational and personal development

**Approach**

We are grounded in an **ethos of co-creation**. We see our work as that of facilitators who work with [[Place]] and [[Practice]] (and the humans stewarding them) to concoct the ideal recipes for long term, systemic catalysis. 

As such, we hold the following perspectives towards evaluation:

1. **Co-creative**: What shall be evaluated (variables), how it will be measured (metrics), what level of growth is expected (standards) are all decided *in consensus with the community* - with processes tailored to match local decision-making practices and actively pulled towards greater self-organization.

2. **Multi-perspectival:** Co-creative processes grounded from context require a multi-capital lens to valuing flows of energy to truly honor the diversity of knowings and associated actions. Our approach is premised on *seeing, valuing and developing all forms of capital* - not just financial and economic. 

3. **Developmental**: We see evaluation as an ongoing act, not just something that begins once the programming is complete. Our tooling is designed to start valuing flows the moment they begin, even before the journey starts, and we intend to provide stakeholders with *live* signals and insights into value generation.

4. **Regenerative**: The direction of our evaluation methodology is towards seeing potential, gauging fit rather than effectiveness, and enabling further experimentation. We are looking for how (& why) different components of the system are growing, not just temporary actions designed to meet short-term needs. **We are placing the capacity, potential and will of the people, the place and *life itself* at the center.**
