[[action-learning journeys]] (ALJs) incubate a context-informed self-organising impulse. one means by which this impulse can express itself is the `docs`, which each [[hubs|hub]] tends to like a digital garden[^1]/ wiki.

![[event-model.png]]

the `docs` begins as a repository template, seeding the start of an ALJ with some preliminary pages. during the course of the onboarding period and the intensive, participants are encouraged to collectively tend to the wiki, making new entries and iterating existing ones. these `docs` are the most comprehensive source of content for all things relating to... 

1. communicating the essence of the place the hub is situated 
2. onboarding future stakeholders into this line of work
3. making visible the learnings generated during the ALJ and beyond
4. embedding data visualisations
5. embedding videos, meeting recordings, photos
6. communicating the value created during the ALJ: product, organisation, ecosystem

# Writing
When writing to the docs, it is important to consider who your audience is. Maintaining a living document that feels cohesive whilst having multiple authors is already challenging. It's important when writing as a group to write with clear principles. Here are the principles with which the prisma team writes by: 

1. Write every page as if its most important audience is reading with care.
2. Write as truthfully as you can transform inspiration into reality.
3. If writing about something that's complex, try to be exact with the language, even giving context to particular words by using a glossary folder. In this folder, we're trying to regenerate each word so that people reading the docs always feel refreshed and like they learned something.
