developers are agents of transformation, transforming creative potential into code. 
developers are sovereign, their agency and ability to discern being absolutely essential for the [[action-learning journeys]] to be able to reach a functional end. 
developers are sometimes inspired by a context that aligns with their purpose, that is, for a system they care about to be able to evolve to a higher order of capability. 

this alignment and care is the prerequisite for effective communication across the various different capacities present in the [[cohort]] - artists, engineers, community leaders, farmers, cooks, and guests, to name just a few. 

each developer will be given access to a dedicated event repo, possibly seeded with preliminary artefacts. 

it is crucial that developers appreciate their relationship with the character and potential of the context in which the ALJ is being hosted. the [[hubs]] play an important role in helping develop those relationships, creating spaces in which local stakeholders can illuminate the locality's systems and particularities.
