developers are agents of transformation, transforming creative potential into code. 
developers are sovereign, their agency and ability to discern being absolutely essential for the [[action-learning journeys]] to be able to reach a functional end. 
developers are inspired by a context that aligns with their purpose, that is, for a system to be able to evolve to a higher order of capability. 

each developer will be given access to a dedicated event repo, possibly seeded with preliminary artefacts.
