[[action-learning journeys]] (ALJs) incubate a context-informed self-organising impulse. one means by which this impulse can express itself is the docs, which each [[communities of place|hub]] tends to like a wiki/ digital garden. [^1]

the docs begins as a repository template, making available a basic wiki outline:

1. Prisma
2. Hub purpose, vision, values
3. ALJ product aims, 

during the course of the onboarding period and the intensive, participants are encouraged to collectively tend to the wiki, making new entries and iterating existing ones. these docs are the most comprehensive source of content for all things relating to... 

1. communicating the essence of the place the hub is situated 
2. onboarding future stakeholders into this line of work
3. archiving learnings generated during the ALJ
4. embedding data visualisations
5. embedding videos, meeting recordings, photos

as well as being a store of markdown files that get published with a static-site generator [^2], the repo template will include additional features, such as: 

1. api to port page content to other sources, such as a website with richer front-end functionality
2.

[^2]: **Static-site generation (SSG)** is a powerful technology for publishing documentation, offering fast, secure, and scalable websites. It supports embedding various media types, including images, videos, audio, and interactive elements like SVGs or iframes. With Markdown as its primary content format, SSGs provide an accessible syntax that is easy for both technical and non-technical users to learn. Additionally, SSG-based sites can be extended with custom themes, plugins, and integrations, allowing for enhanced functionality tailored to specific documentation needs.
