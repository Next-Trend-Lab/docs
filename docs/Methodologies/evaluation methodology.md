Why: Regenerative systems need tools that capture non-linear, ecosystem-based impact metrics that go beyond conventional ROI. Building a proprietary “e-valuation” (energy in motion and ecosystem valuation) protocol could make your company a go-to for funders and communities seeking tangible progress indicators that reflect ecosystemic health, community engagement, and sustainable value creation.

How: Create an e-valuation protocol with metrics that track ecological, social, and economic flows over time. This could include tools for tracking energy exchanges, resource flows, and social value, as well as adaptations communities make as they learn. Real-time data feedback can enable project participants to adjust practices, strengthening long-term regenerative outcomes. Partnering with sensor tech, bioinformatics, or real-time analytics could also help capture subtle but crucial indicators, like soil health, water cycles, or social wellbeing.
