With these methodologies, prisma designs and [[Facilitation|facilitates]] a multi-stakeholder [[enactment]], grounded in partner [[communities of place|hubs]] in different [[bioregion|bioregions]]. Through our [[enrolment]] process, we onboard the following stakeholders into a multi-week alignment process, culminating in an [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]]:

1. [[communities of place]]
2. [[communities of practice]]
3. [[participants]]
4. [[partners]]

The [[product]] of each action-learning journey is a [[case-study]]. These case-studies are a multi-media, multi-perspective account of the experience, that serve the purpose of offering the learnings to a broader audience. The content of these case-studies is produced throughout the process with a kind of participation-as-content-creation practice:

1. meeting recordings
2. learning exercises
3. documentation
4. various participation signals (more to come)
5. certificates of participation

In addition to generating the above learning material, which is occurring at the participation level, there is a second order of production aims, which exists at three levels:

1. Features/ feature sets (e.g. apps)
2. Organisations/ organisational forms that support the ongoing development and application of practice (e.g. DAOs, startups)
3. Ecosystem shifts and pathways (e.g. an integrative co-design roadmap with multiple stakeholders and aligned partners at the landscape/ ecosystem level)

The core methodologies being worked on so far are:
1. [[enrolment]]
2. [[potentialise|ground-potentialising]]
3. [[enactment|enacting]]
4. [[developmental evaluation|evaluating]]
5. [[process infrastructuring]]
