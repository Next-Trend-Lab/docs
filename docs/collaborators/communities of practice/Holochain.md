## **Holochain: Weaving Decentralized Threads into Our Work**

_A partnership rooted in agent-centricity, distributed power, and a reverence for complexity._

Imagine a world where technology empowers individuals and communities rather than concentrating power in the hands of a few. Where data is owned by its creators, not by corporations. Where systems are designed to adapt and evolve alongside the people they serve. This is the promise of Holochain, and it’s why we consider them a core partner in our mission to catalyze regenerative systems change.

## **Beyond Blockchain: Agent-Centricity**

While blockchain has its merits, Holochain offers something fundamentally different: an agent-centric architecture that aligns perfectly with our commitment to community-led design and [[sociocratic organising|self-organizing]] systems.

In a blockchain, every transaction is recorded on a shared ledger, creating a single source of truth that can be both powerful and limiting. Holochain, on the other hand, distributes data across individual "agents," each with their own secure and private ledger.

This means that:

- **Individuals own their data**: Participants retain control over their personal information and contributions, rather than surrendering it to a centralized authority.
    
- **Systems adapt to local contexts**: Each community can tailor their Holochain-based applications to reflect their unique needs and cultural nuances.
    
- **Scalability is built-in**: Holochain's distributed architecture allows it to scale more efficiently than blockchains, making it ideal for large, complex ecosystems.
    

## **How Holochain Supports Prisma's Vision**

We are still in the process of mapping out the details of our integration with Holochain. Here are the main things to know:

1. **Enabling Self-Organization:** Holochain is helping us by enabling the community to self-organize without our intervention. It is helping with keeping track of commitments, and tracking who is doing what, and why.
    
2. **Ecosystems of Trust:** Holochain helps us to build trust and trust relationships through a transparent and verifiable system.
    
3. **Value beyond measure:** With a clear focus to track gestures, the system helps to provide insights into the ways that we can measure value and how to understand it.
    

## **Our Vision for Holochain within our ecosystem**

Our focus is to work to ensure that the various roles are integrated and understood:

1. Multi-Stakeholder Experimentation & Evaluation: With Holochain, we can evaluate the actions in real-world experiments, making it easier to share complex systemic insights.
    
2. Mapping and Supporting Systemic Value Flows: Through the power of decentralization, we can now recognize, track, and exchange non-financial flows of value (e.g., knowledge, time, energy) in a way that supports collective system health.
    
3. Transparent Communication & Complexity-Honoring Narratives: Our goal is to create a decentralized, evolving knowledge network where the ecosystem self-organizes, prioritizing the most useful insights through network effects.
    

## **Use Cases: Practical Applications**

1. **Decentralized Enrolment:** This is being done through the track of comittments, by mapping out who is doing what, when, and why.
    
2. **Adaptive Governance:** All are able to determine where a participant may need help.
    
3. **Shared Knowledge**: A shared, global pool of knowledge for all members who can access for information and to better collaborate.
    

## **Next Steps: Co-Creating a Regenerative Future**

As we continue to evolve, our relationship with Holochain will only deepen.

- Identify key resources as well as what success will look like.
    
- Prototype systems that are peer-led to encourage contribution.
    

## **Our Call**

By working hand-in-hand with Holochain, we can create a more just, sustainable, and thriving world—one where technology empowers communities to steward their own destinies.
