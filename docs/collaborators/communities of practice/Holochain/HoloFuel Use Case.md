## **Mapping and Supporting Systemic Value Flows**

_Weaving the invisible threads of contribution into a regenerative tapestry_

In the heart of every [[action-learning journey]] lies a complex web of contributions—some visible, others hidden from view. Like the mycelial networks beneath a forest floor, these exchanges of value nourish the entire ecosystem, yet often remain unacknowledged in conventional economic frameworks. A core part of our work at Prisma, and our perspective on *true regeneration*, is making these invisible flows visible, honoring the full spectrum of gifts that sustain our collective work.

## **The Challenge: Valuing the Invisible**

Prisma's action-learning journeys generate many types of contributions—facilitation, research, mentorship, funding, emotional support, cultural wisdom—all essential for system health. Yet these non-financial value flows often go untracked and unrecognized. Without a structured way to acknowledge and exchange these contributions, vital work remains undervalued, and participants may struggle to sustain their efforts over time.

This challenge mirrors a broader pattern in our economic systems, where only certain forms of value (typically financial) are recognized, while others—often those most essential to life—are rendered invisible or exploited.

## **Holochain-Based Multi-Unit Value Tracking**

We would like to use [[Holochain]]'s agent-centric architecture and multi-unit implementation to implement a multi-unit value tracking system that allows us to honor, validate, and exchange different types of contributions while maintaining a decentralized, peer-led approach. 

Part of the facilitation and evaluation design for each action learning journey is  This system doesn't reduce value to a single metric but preserves the rich diversity of gifts that flow through our ecosystem.

## **Defining Value Units**

Our ecosystem involves different types of contributions that sustain action-learning journeys. These can be categorized into three core service units:

- **Facilitation Units** (guiding sessions, conflict resolution, holding space)
    
- **Knowledge Units** (research, documentation, sharing expertise)
    
- **Stewardship Units** (hosting events, providing logistical support, funding)
    

Each of these service units is recorded on a Holochain-based ledger, allowing participants to see and acknowledge the full spectrum of contributions that sustain our collective work.

## **Contribution Recording & Validation**

The beauty of this system lies in its peer-to-peer validation process:

1. When a participant offers a service (e.g., hosting a session, providing research), they log it as a transaction on the distributed ledger.
    
2. Another participant validates the contribution by attesting to its completion (mutual validation prevents fraud).
    
3. The system automatically updates the contributor's balance in the relevant service unit.
    

**Example Scenario:**  
During the Accra ALJ, Person A facilitates a dialogue on systemic shifts → Logs 5 Facilitation Units. Person B, who attended the session, validates it → The units are added to A's balance. If desired, A can later exchange these Facilitation Units for Knowledge Units (e.g., receiving research support from someone else in the network).

## **Peer-to-Peer Exchange of Contributions**

Unlike conventional economic systems that require central intermediaries, our approach enables direct exchanges between peers:

- Participants can offer or request services in a decentralized exchange.
    
- If a participant has excess Facilitation Units but needs Stewardship Units (e.g., venue support), they can request an exchange.
    
- The system matches contributors based on needs, enabling a fluid, trust-based value ecosystem without reliance on money.
    

## **Visualizing Systemic Value Flows**

A dashboard displays:

- Who contributed what, in which service unit
    
- How contributions are flowing across the ecosystem
    
- Gaps or imbalances (e.g., too many Knowledge Units, not enough Facilitation)
    

This ensures that no essential contribution goes unnoticed, and collective sustainability is maintained over time.

## **Why This Matters for Regenerative Systems**

This approach to mapping and supporting systemic value flows aligns deeply with our commitment to regenerative principles:

- **Recognizes Non-Financial Value**: Makes invisible contributions visible & meaningful.  
- **Strengthens Peer Trust & Reciprocity**: Encourages exchange over extraction.  
- **Reduces Dependence on External Funding**: Enables a self-sustaining contribution economy.  
- **Aligns with Holochain's Decentralized, Agent-Centric Model**: No central authority is needed.

By honoring the full spectrum of contributions that sustain our work, we create the conditions for true abundance—not through accumulation, but through the continuous flow of gifts within a living system.
