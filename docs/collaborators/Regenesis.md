it's important to remember when reading the page for [[communities of practice]] that a high proportion of the thinking behind how this project has originated comes from co-designing with Regenesis. 

implicit within much of the designing described in [[communities of practice]] is that this is tailored to and in service of the regenesis story of place program, set to launch in fall 2025. the [[collaborative innovation intensives]] referred to in [[communities of practice]] as, general events, can be thought of here as a carefully considered meeting of two worlds at a precisely timed moment within a larger evolutionary trajectory.

this meeting of two worlds - on the one hand, regenerative practice, and, on the other, software development - begins with the premise that in order for the quality of each practitioners' work to be justly reflected in a case study, on a digital platform, the software development cannot take place as a process entirely dissociated from the context of the work itself.

so it was that the creative tension was introduced: how to reconcile the need to serve a globally distributed community of practice in communicating their work, where each practitioner is working to realise place-sourced potential in their own context in their own way, without flattening, reducing, homogenising the communication process?
