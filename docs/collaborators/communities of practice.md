the purpose of this page is to communicate how the capabilities being developed by prisma - work in service to evolving communities of practice, such as [[Regenesis]] [^1] practice of regenerative development and design. at the core of our [[prisma methodologies|methodologies]] are the dynamic interplays between the forward movement of [[enactment|enacting]] and the ongoing, reflective and integrative movement of [[developmental evaluation|evaluating]]. found at the end of this page is a roadmap, made up of interim states working toward an end-state, including images for each. this page is guided by the aim of highlighting the alignment with the [[Regenesis]] story of place program, in terms of literal transposition of organisation capabilities onto process.

prisma is a [[process design collective]] that facilitates [[Place-Source|place-sourced]] [[collaborative innovation intensives|collaborative innovation intensives]], referred to from hereon also as an event. innovation intensives are a period of rapid innovation guided by a facilitator team that has been co-designing with the [[communities of place]] for a number of months - each event requiring several months of intention development, co-design, alignment and systems onboarding.[^2] In order for there to be the capabilities needed to [[Regenesis|deliver]] x18 intensives in the first three years, starting with a team of 5-6 core contributors, we need to...

design a [[Holochain|minimum viable governance system]] to work with two streams of financial capital flows that maintain...

1. External capability development of event [[participants]]
	- code, [[practice]] and [[product]] quality
	- place-unique (digital) expressions of developmental inquiries into the essence of place [^3]
2. Internal capability development
	- increasing the capability of the core facilitator team to work with the underlying patterns that generate the capacities needed to organise [[collaborative innovation intensives]] 
	- increasing [[process design collective|order]] of design and effect

see the preliminary [[budget allocation]] for more context. 

both streams of financial capital flows are being circulated in service to activating and making visible the multiple forms of value creation and exchange occurrent in the thriving of regenerative community. these events, developed in partnership with regional hubs and their [[communities of place]], aim to be a catalytic agent for self-expression of place-sourced practices being developed and applied in alignment with increasing orders of bioregional wealth. such action-learning intensives, their body taking shape as an event, comprise of: 

- **SYSTEMS:** systems of place and systems of endeavour/ intervention, such as
	- knowledge commoning
	- villaging systems
	- land-relations (and what is known as property)
	- food systems, and more...
- **PRACTICE:** application and learning/ integration, or, [[enactment]] and [[developmental evaluation|evaluation]]
- **COMMUNITY:** communities of practice and [[communities of place]]

> *aim to* apply this governance system to facilitate the organisation of place-sourced [[collaborative innovation intensives]]â€¦

> *so that* the instrument used to communicate the application of practice can evolve **with** the community of practice and the evolving practice itself. 

this governance system aims to multiply the capacity of the facilitator team by creating the conditions that enable...

- **ORGANISATION:** [[enrolment|self-organisation]] by event participants and facilitators for each event instance
- **INTEGRITY:** stewardship of the alignment between the place-sourced [[product|products]] of the intensives and the potential of the non-local community of practice the intensives are being organised for (i.e. [[resourcing]])
- **EVOLVABILITY:** continuity of development impulse beyond the timeframe of the first intensive (see [[incubation methodology]])

the following core facilitation team is forming to bring that governance system and its capacity-multiplying capabilities into being:

- [[Delfina Terrado]]: [[enactment|enacting]], [[experience design]], [[incubation methodology]], [[practice-based daos]]
- [[Shikhar Agarwal]]: [[developmental evaluation|evaluating]], [[value-system design methodology]], [[Holochain|place-sourced currency design]]
- [[Mercy Fordwoo]]: [[potentialise|potentialising]], [[hub networking]]
- [[Ryah Chandler]]: [[enrolment]]
- [[Tobias Fechner]]: [[process infrastructuring]]

at the highest level, each event is the alignment of the following four processes. these stages each receive a sub-domain dedicated to engaging a wider audience with the inner workings of event organising. these sub-domains become the endpoints by which [[communities of place]] (hubs) can integrate their place-unique expressions of working with the essence of place in a global-scale, self-evolving platform.

1. [[enrolment]] 
	- stakeholder engagement
	- participant, practice and systems onboarding
2. [[potentialise|potentialising]] 
	- fostering relational depth
	- accumulating intention
	- imaging place-sourced potential (hubs platforming local network activity)
3. [[enactment|enacting]] 
	- practice embodiment
	- learning by doing
	- organisation forming
4. [[developmental evaluation|evaluating]]
	- shifting systems [flows](https://metacurrency.org/faq/#qaef-1035)
	- making visible the effects of systems interventions 
	- reflecting on the approach, harvesting learnings, integrating into practice evolution

we will aim to automate the registering and configuring of sub-domains, minimum viable service/ api deployments and testing, and porting back into a global visibility mapping interface. these endpoints are the means for communicating activity on-the-ground and the stem for each event-specific code repository.

event capacities are sourced from at least the following four stakeholder groups:

1. [[participants]]
2. [[communities of place]]
3. [[communities of practice]]
4. [[partners]]

these [stakeholder development pathways](https://register.prisma.events) are being designed to XXX

the [[process infrastructuring]] developed to support the organisation of each event instance is also designed to be configurable and self-contained, able to be deployed to a server/ [[Holochain|device]] network local to the [[communities of place]] hosting the event. the purpose of this is to align with the aim of building capacity in-place for ongoing development of the products incubated during the intensive. 

instruments supporting this process design are:

- [[publishing engine]]
- [[Core Facilitator Capacity|patterns for facilitator teams]]
- [[DID System]]
- A financing distribution methodology and tooling, both internal and external. See [[capital distribution]].
- Organisational agreements making serving [[incubation methodology|intensives as incubation processes]]
- [[speech-to-currency]] serving place-unique [[practice-based daos]]

a year will be given for the governance system described above to first be practiced by the core facilitator team to organise events with a pilot cohort of 6 on-the-ground practitioner groups.
