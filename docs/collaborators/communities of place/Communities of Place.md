_Where roots run deep, and belonging takes form_

Imagine a circle drawn not on a map, but in the heart—a circle that encompasses a watershed, a forest, a village square. This is the essence of a Community of Place: a collective bound together by shared geography, by a common thread of belonging to a particular patch of Earth.

More than just a location, a Community of Place is a living organism—a breathing, evolving entity shaped by the unique interplay of ecology, culture, and history. It is where the land speaks, and where generations weave their stories into the very soil beneath their feet. It’s a place for hub activity, a place where processes infrastructure themselves.

## **The Whisper of Belonging**

In a world increasingly fractured and dislocated, Communities of Place offer a refuge—a grounding force that reminds us of our interconnectedness. It is where we find:

- **Shared Heritage**: The traditions, rituals, and ancestral wisdom that connect us to those who came before.
    
- **Mutual Responsibility**: A sense of stewardship for the land and for each other, recognizing that our well-being is inextricably linked.
    
- **Local Knowledge**: A deep understanding of the unique ecological and cultural dynamics of our region, guiding our actions and shaping our decisions.
    
- Hubs for transition that are identified by the local changemakers.
    

They are what you identify with in your bioregion. They help enable code-design, they promote humility, they have a high level of quality holding, and they show the way, openly, and with a good heart.

## **Ecosystems of Care**

Communities of Place are not isolated entities. They are integral parts of larger [[bioregion|bioregional]] networks, interconnected with other communities and ecosystems, both near and far. They thrive on the exchange of knowledge, resources, and support, recognizing that their collective well-being depends on the health of the whole.

They become the local changemakers, and identify themselves to the rest of the world. That initial spark is what truly makes this whole place worthwhile. It is the heart of the onboarded process, and as such, it is their responsibility to organize around everything that has taken place.

Within these interwoven communities, there are many forms of care, including:

- **Environmental Stewardship**: Protecting and restoring the health of the land, water, and air, ensuring that future generations can thrive.
    
- **Social Justice**: Promoting equity, inclusion, and respect for all members of the community, recognizing that diversity is a source of strength.
    
- **Economic Resilience**: Building local economies that are rooted in sustainable practices, creating opportunities for all to prosper.
    

## **The Seed of Change**

It is from Communities of Place that true transformation begins to take root. By grounding ourselves in the wisdom of our local ecosystems and honoring the unique narratives of our people, we can create new pathways toward a more just, sustainable, and thriving world.

Like the mycorrhizal networks that connect trees in a forest, Communities of Place offer a foundation for systemic change, fostering resilience, adaptability, and a deep sense of belonging that nourishes the soul. It is where we remember that we are not separate from nature but an integral part of its intricate web of life.

They form hubs for other ecosystems to sprout, to grow, to connect with, and to become a part of. When communities of place work well, they are beautiful, and they are forever.

## **A Call to Ground**

In a world that often feels overwhelming, let us remember the power of place. Let us return to our roots, reconnect with our communities, and rediscover the wisdom of the land. For it is in these circles of belonging that we find the strength, the inspiration, and the guidance we need to create a future worthy of our descendants.
