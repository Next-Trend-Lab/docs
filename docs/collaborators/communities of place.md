# hubs
hub will be identified by local changemaker or identify itself as the host of the event. that's the way that the whole onboarding process becomes activiated and other stakeholders organise around that. hub's enable the process of co-design. trust cannot be sped up. hubs may take the form of

- community learning centres
- bioregional learning centres
- cooperatives/ hosts of cooperative collectives
- co-living/ co-working spaces actively playing a role of stewarding transition in their region

incentive

humility

quality of holding

openness to what local stakeholders bring

will fail a few times, hopefully
