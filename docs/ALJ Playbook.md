Here's a hyper-practical, minimally-abstract step-by-step rundown of how an [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]] (ALJ) could look like...

1. Hub vision activation
	1. Find a [[hubs|hub]] or a practitioner working closely with a community centre.
	2. Adopt a view of its place as nested systems.
	3. Work with the hub on seeing [[place-sourced potential]].
	4. Once potential is seen, work on identifying the hub's role in realising that potential.
	5. Once the hub has seen its role, it may be able to see the contribution[^1] it is called to make.
2. Calling in an ALJ
	1. Ideally the contribution requires at least some of the following...
		1. working at multiple levels of the system
		2. working with different capacities (art, technology, community, health, finance)
		3. working close to or beyond the boundaries of status-quo[^2]
		4. seeming constraints (bootstrapping/ self-organising ethos)
	2. The hub team then calls in the start of the process to start potentialising a future ALJ by posting an ***event page*** that details the stakeholders that will be aligned to realise potential through the ALJ[^3]
	3. A facilitator team organises around this prospective ALJ, starting to work closely with the hub team on-the-ground to develop place-sourced practices that will be employed to actualise the system potential
	4. Together, they develop place-specific versions of the four [[core processes]] available to support the organising of an ALJ
3. Facilitating via the four core processes
	1. Enrolment: the hub and facilitator teams steward the inviting of additional energies in such a way as to align different capacities (roles) around the vision of potential that will be realised during the ALJ.
	2. Ground-potentialising: carefully managing expectations by balancing the realities on-the-ground with the potential being seen. This process addresses constraining ALJ scope, helping name the focus, seeing the approach lines up with the desired outcome, and engaging external parties interested in those outcomes.
	3. Action: designing the facilitation needed for self-organising emergence in a way to produce a tech innovation, informed by the unique context of their place and designed from a living systems paradigm, where the experiential learning process itself is the experimentation by which they embody a potential system state and can use that collective insight to generate a precise intervention.
	4. Evaluation: making visible the flows of energy unique to this place in a way that they can be valued. 
4. Generating data[^4] on...
	1. How participants grew capacities in themselves and the systems they're part of
	2. How practice was applied
	3. How different stakeholders embodied organisational forms as a means to coordinate 
5. Publishing a dynamic case-study showing...
	1. 
6. Registering subscribers, generating revenue as a means to
	2. earn income, finance another ALJ
	3. attract interest to work on the essence of place

[^1]: A contribution may take many forms. This needs to be something that comes from the heart of those working most committed and carefully with the essence of a place. It might be to reconnect two communities with broken history. It could be to introduce a new project that would help unblock energy and open up new directions. It could be to bring innovation and arts into a community losing young talent to foreign job markets. It could be to steer a river to steward its health long into the future. 

[^2]: Our work is about transitioning from is to what could be and back again to make it a reality. The [Three-Horizons framework](https://www.h3uni.org/foundational-insights/seeing-and-thinking-in-three-horizons/) is a useful reference. Being determined to push the boundaries and experiment out beyond norms is a great quality to bring into organising an ALJ.

[^3]: Different ticket types could be made for different stakeholders, granting and gating access as desired: locals, desired skill capacities, institutions, external funders, external capacity providers etc. The
