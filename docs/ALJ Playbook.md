As a checklist for any organising team(s):

**1. Enrolment: Aligning Energies Around Potential**

- [ ]  **Hub and facilitation teams** identified and aligned around the vision.
- [ ]  Roles and responsibilities clearly defined.
- [ ]  Invitations extended to diverse stakeholders (community, sector experts, facilitators, etc.).
- [ ]  Alignment of capacities (art, tech, community, etc.) with the event’s vision.
- [ ]  Clear process for **role fit** to ensure alignment with event goals.
- [ ]  **Stakeholder expectations** managed around the ALJ's vision of potential.

**2. Ground-Potentializing: Managing Scope & Readiness**

- [ ]  **Clear focus for the ALJ** is defined (what’s the core problem or opportunity?).
- [ ]  Scope of the event **contained**—preventing overreach while still allowing for flexibility.
- [ ]  **On-the-ground realities** mapped (e.g., logistical, cultural, financial).
- [ ]  **Alignment** between the approach (process, methods) and the desired outcomes.
- [ ]  **External parties** (government, funders, experts) engaged where needed.
- [ ]  **Communication channels** set up for ongoing updates and feedback loops.
- [ ]  **Contingency plans** for unforeseen constraints or changes.

**3. Action: Designing for Self-Organizing Emergence**

- [ ]  Facilitation design that **supports self-organization**—ensuring autonomy while maintaining focus.
- [ ]  **Context-specific practices** are identified to reflect the place’s unique dynamics.
- [ ]  Event designed with a **living systems approach**—encouraging natural flows and interconnectedness.
- [ ]  Clear facilitation strategies for **embodying a potential system state** (role play, prototyping, etc.).
- [ ]  **Tools and methods** prepared to track emergent actions (e.g., feedback mechanisms, observation).
- [ ]  Opportunities for **hands-on learning and experimentation** included.

**4. Evaluation: Making Flows of Energy Visible & Valued**

- [ ]  **Evaluation metrics** defined (not just outcome-based but energy flows, relationships, etc.).
- [ ]  Tools for making **invisible shifts visible** (e.g., stories, feedback, surveys).
- [ ]  **Documentation strategies** in place to capture the energy, relationships, and outputs.
- [ ]  **Reflection periods** built into the event to assess progress and adjust actions.
- [ ]  Methods for **sharing results** with external stakeholders or wider community.
- [ ]  Follow-up plans to ensure the insights or innovations continue post-event.

While the above checklist focuses on the ***facilitation processes*** of an ALJ, almost all conventional elements around organising an event should also be considered:

1. **Logistics**
    - [ ]  Venue logistics (location, capacity, accessibility).
    - [ ]  **Technical setup** (AV, internet, equipment, materials).
    - [ ]  **Budget and financial planning** (funding, expenses, donations, grants).
    - [ ]  **Transportation and accommodation** (for remote participants or speakers).

2. **Marketing & Communication**
    - [ ]  **Marketing materials** (event pages, brochures, flyers).
    - [ ]  **Communication strategy** (pre-event updates, social media, email).
    - [ ]  **Branding and messaging** (clear communication of the event’s vision and objectives).

3. **Participant Engagement**
    - [ ]  **Onboarding materials** for participants (event guidelines, schedules).
    - [ ]  **Clear call-to-action** for participants—what is expected of them?
    - [ ]  **Support for diverse needs** (language, accessibility, emotional support).

4. **Risk Management**    
    - [ ]  **Health and safety protocols** in place.
    - [ ]  **Insurance coverage** (for public liability, cancellation, etc.).
    - [ ]  **Emergency procedures** (for accidents, crises, or unexpected situations).

5. **Post-Event Follow-Up**    
    - [ ]  **Survey for participant feedback** (gather insights on experience and improvement).
    - [ ]  **Evaluation report** (summarize outcomes, learnings, and next steps).
    - [ ]  **Continued community engagement** (to sustain momentum and outcomes).

Now for some more description:
# 1. Hub vision activation
A **hub** is a key nodal actor in this process—an entity or practitioner deeply embedded in a place and connected to its people, ecosystems, and ongoing initiatives. The hub serves as both a grounding force and a catalyst, holding the vision for what is _possible_ rather than just reacting to problems. This step is about working with the hub to activate a **regenerative design lens**, recognizing place as a living system full of untapped potential.

#### **1.1 Identifying a Hub**

- Look for a **community-embedded practitioner** or an organization, such as a **community center, local initiative, or place-based network**, that already plays a connective role.
- The ideal hub has **relational depth**—trusted connections with diverse actors in the community—and the ability to **coordinate across different scales** (local, regional, systemic).

#### **1.2 Seeing Place as a Living System**

- Support the hub in **adopting a "nested systems" perspective**, recognizing how their place is interconnected with larger social, ecological, and economic flows.
- Shift from **problem-based thinking** (fixing what’s broken) to **potential-based thinking** (activating what wants to emerge).
- Use **systems mapping, storytelling, or embodied practice** to surface unseen connections and regenerative opportunities.

#### **1.3 Identifying Place-Sourced Potential**

- Work with the hub to **see beyond immediate challenges** and uncover **emerging opportunities for transformation**.
- Ask: What unique strengths, relationships, and resources already exist here? What new patterns or experiments could emerge?
- This step is about **revealing what the place is calling for**, rather than imposing external solutions.

#### **1.4 Clarifying the Hub’s Role in Realizing Potential**

- Once the potential is recognized, explore **how the hub can best serve as an enabler of change**.
- This could involve **bridging relationships, hosting spaces for co-creation, testing regenerative models, or amplifying local knowledge**.

#### **1.5 Seeing the Hub’s Unique Contribution**

- As the hub clarifies its role, it will begin to see the **specific contribution it is called to make** within the wider system.
- This contribution should be **aligned with the hub’s existing capacities**, but also stretch into new possibilities for self-organizing, collaboration, and systemic impact.
# 2. Calling in an ALJ
#### **2.1 Identifying Key Contributors**
The success of an ALJ depends on the right mix of people who bring cross-sectoral expertise, systems thinking, and a commitment to working beyond the status quo. Ideally, contributors should:

- **Work across multiple levels of the system** (from grassroots organizing to institutional change).
- **Bring diverse capacities** (e.g., arts, technology, community organizing, health, finance, governance).
- **Operate at or beyond conventional boundaries** (experimenting with new models of collaboration, policy, and action).
- **Thrive in constraint-driven environments** (bootstrapping, self-organizing, and adapting in real time).
- Be keen for a highly-emergent environment, welcoming of uncertainty and able to open themselves up to navigating complexity as an unavoidable condition of working on activating living systems potential

#### **2.2 Making the Call: Launching the ALJ Invitation**

The **hub team** initiates the process by:
- **Posting an event page or invitation** that clearly communicates:
    - The purpose and vision of the ALJ.
    - The key themes and challenges it will explore.
    - The stakeholders and participants being aligned to co-create the experience.
    - The open call for facilitators, contributors, and key roles.
- **Ensuring clarity on roles** within the ALJ, so participants understand how they can engage meaningfully.
#### **2.3 Forming the Facilitation Core**

- A **facilitation team** emerges around the ALJ, coalescing as a core group responsible for shaping the journey.
- This team works **closely with the hub team on the ground** to:
    - Understand the unique needs and dynamics of the local place.
    - Develop **place-sourced practices** that make the ALJ deeply relevant to its context.
#### **2.4 Designing the Core Processes**

- The facilitation and hub teams **co-create a localized version** of the **four core processes** that will guide the ALJ’s flow.
- These processes should be:
    - **Grounded in real-world conditions**—designed for emergence rather than pre-set agendas.
    - **Tangible and embodied**—ensuring participants actively _do_ rather than just discuss.
    - **Iterative and responsive**—able to shift as new insights emerge.
# 3. Facilitating via the four core processes

Once the hub and facilitation team are in place, the next step is to design **place-specific versions** of the four core facilitation processes. Each process corresponds to a key facilitator role and serves as a guiding structure for channelling energy into the **Action Learning Journey (ALJ) intensive**—the multi-stakeholder container for emergent action.

#### **3.1 Enrolment: Aligning Energies Around Potential**

- The **hub and facilitator teams** steward the process of inviting additional participants, ensuring that diverse capacities (roles) align with the **vision of potential** emerging through the ALJ.
- This is more than recruitment—it’s about **intentional weaving** of relationships, ensuring that each participant plays a meaningful part in realizing the system’s potential.

#### **3.2 Ground-Potentializing: Managing Scope & Readiness**

- This process ensures that **expectations are balanced** between on-the-ground realities and the larger vision.
- The facilitation team works to:
    - **Define a clear focus** for the ALJ.
    - **Ensure alignment between approach and intended outcomes.**
    - **Engage external stakeholders** whose interests connect to the envisioned outcomes.
- This step **contains the ALJ scope**, preventing it from becoming too diffuse while still allowing for emergence.

#### **3.3 Action: Designing for Self-Organizing Emergence**

- The facilitation team **creates conditions** for participants to engage in **self-organizing action** that leads to a tangible **innovation, prototype, or intervention**.
- This process is:
    - **Informed by the unique place-based context** and its dynamics.
    - **Designed from a living systems paradigm**, where the experience itself becomes the experiment.
    - **Focused on embodiment**—participants don’t just discuss, they enact and inhabit a **potential system state** in real time.
- The collective insights from this phase drive a **precise, emergent intervention**.

#### **3.4 Evaluation: Making Flows of Energy Visible & Valued**

- Rather than standard metrics, this process tracks **how energy moves through the ALJ**—what is activated, where value is created, and how it continues beyond the event.
- The facilitation team makes visible:
    - **The new relationships, insights, and capacities formed.**
    - **The shifts in perspective or practice that emerge.**
    - **The regenerative potential seeded in the place.**
- This ensures that the ALJ **leaves a lasting imprint**, not just in actions taken but in **new ways of being and working that sustain beyond the event**.

[^1]: A contribution may take many forms. This needs to be something that comes from the heart of those working most committed and carefully with the essence of a place. It might be to reconnect two communities with broken history. It could be to introduce a new project that would help unblock energy and open up new directions. It could be to bring innovation and arts into a community losing young talent to foreign job markets. It could be to steer a river to steward its health long into the future. 

[^2]: Our work is about transitioning from is to what could be and back again to make it a reality. The [Three-Horizons framework](https://www.h3uni.org/foundational-insights/seeing-and-thinking-in-three-horizons/) is a useful reference. Being determined to push the boundaries and experiment out beyond norms is a great quality to bring into organising an ALJ.

[^3]: Different ticket types could be made for different stakeholders, granting and gating access as desired: locals, desired skill capacities, institutions, external funders, external capacity providers etc. The
