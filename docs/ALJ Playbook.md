Here's a hyper-practical, minimally-abstract step-by-step rundown of how an [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]] (ALJ) could look like...

1. Hub vision activation
	1. Find a [[hubs|hub]] or a practitioner working closely with a community centre.
	2. Adopt a view of its place as nested systems.
	3. Work with the hub on seeing [[place-sourced potential]].
	4. Once potential is seen, work on identifying the hub's role in realising that potential.
	5. Once the hub has seen its role, it may be able to see the contribution[^1] it is called to make.
2. Calling in an [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]]
	1. Ideally the contribution requires at least some of the following...
		1. working at multiple levels of the system
		2. working with different capacities (art, technology, community, health, finance)
		3. working close to or beyond the boundaries of status-quo [^2]
		4. seeming constraints (bootstrapping/ self-organising ethos)
	2. The hub team then calls in the start of the process to organise an ALJ
	3. 

[^1]: A contribution may take many forms. This needs to be something that comes from the heart of those working most committed and carefully with the essence of a place. It might be to reconnect two communities with broken history. It could be to introduce a new project that would help unblock energy and open up new directions. It could be to bring innovation and arts into a community losing young talent to foreign job markets. It could be to steer a river to steward its health long into the future. 
[^2]: Our work is about transitioning from is to what could be and back again to make it a reality. The [Three-Horizons framework](https://www.h3uni.org/foundational-insights/seeing-and-thinking-in-three-horizons/) is a useful reference. Being determined to push the boundaries and experiment out beyond norms is a great quality to bring into organising an ALJ.
