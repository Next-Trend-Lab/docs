Okay, I've reviewed both documents and identified concepts and practices that are referenced but could benefit from having their own wiki pages or more detailed explanations. Based on that information, let's prioritize creating mini-wiki pages for the following, with clear language and specific, hypothetical case examples:

---

### **1. Storytelling with Metaphors & Symbols**
**Concept**: This is about using stories, metaphors, and symbols to communicate complex ideas in a relatable and engaging way. It helps people connect emotionally and intuitively with systemic concepts.

**Example Use Case**: Imagine a community facing water scarcity. Instead of presenting data, a facilitator tells a story of a river spirit that is suffering due to overuse. The story invokes a sense of connection and responsibility, leading to collaborative solutions for water conservation.

---

### **2. Embodied Systemic Constellations**
**Concept**: This is a method where participants physically represent elements of a system (e.g., stakeholders, resources) and explore their relationships through movement and interaction. It reveals hidden dynamics and patterns.

**Example Use Case**: In a workshop on food systems, participants embody roles like "farmer," "consumer," and "distributor." Through movement and interaction, they experience the interconnectedness and tensions within the system, leading to insights about fair pricing and sustainable practices.

---

### **3. Persona**
**Concept**: Creating representative archetypes of key stakeholders to understand their needs, motivations, and pain points. Personas humanize data and inform the design of effective solutions.

**Example Use Case**: A team designing a new digital tool for local farmers creates personas like "Tech-Savvy Farmer" and "Traditional Farmer." These personas help them tailor the tool's features and usability to meet the diverse needs of their target audience.
