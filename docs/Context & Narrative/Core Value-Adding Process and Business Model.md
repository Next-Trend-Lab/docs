We outline our business model, showing its innovative approach to scaling systems change through real-world experimentation.

- [[action-learning journeys]]: We host events where participants are part of experiential learning journeys, engaging with both cutting-edge technologies and place-sourced practices. These residencies take place in bioregional hubs, where we incubate new solutions that are informed by the context of local communities.
- [[evaluation methodology]]: Our evaluation process acts as a capital distribution system, where a small percentage of the value generated is reinvested into future projects, driving both growth and impact.
- [[case studies]]
