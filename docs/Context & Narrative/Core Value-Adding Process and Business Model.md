We outline our business model, showing its innovative approach to scaling systems change through real-world experimentation.

- **Collaborative Innovation Intensives**: "We host events where participants undergo accredited, transformational learning journeys, engaging with both cutting-edge technologies and indigenous practices. These residencies take place in bioregional hubs, where we incubate new solutions that are integrated into the local ecosystem."
- **Capital Distribution System**: "Our evaluation process acts as a capital distribution system, where a small percentage of the value generated is reinvested into future projects, driving both growth and impact."
