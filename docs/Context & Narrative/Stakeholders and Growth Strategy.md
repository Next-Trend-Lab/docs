# Stakeholders and Growth Strategy
2025 will see the delivery of the [Accra action-learning journey](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/f13-cardano-open-ecosystem/wada-hub-hackathon-a-local-community-catalyst), the start of the [[Regenesis]] Story of Place programme, and potentially a few other exciting collaborations. 

The image above shows the same underlying pattern of event organising, which applies four [[core processes]], across three different contexts:

	A. Accra: Wada Hub in Accra, Ghana, for the Cardano Catalyst Fund 13 application
	B. Regenesis: Several events within the Story of Place programme
	C. Regenerative Investing: [atreyu](https://www.atreyu.global) & ria

In all the [[Action-learning journeys]] (ALJs), we are aiming to form one or multiple action-learning teams that work on-the-ground on the development and application of an instrument (tooling). 

Each ALJ also generates content: videos, interviews, call recordings, wikis, art works. This content is curated by the [[hubs]] to publish case-studies of the process. 

These case studies are developmental learning accounts: each with levels of depth. Our [[Core Value-Adding Process and Business Model|business model]] centres around the subscription to these journeys to access the depth. Each event is a catalyst for the ongoing *storying* of the work, ongoing learning and action, evolving thinking, making the subscription model appropriate. Communities of place own these learning accounts and are the primary recipients of subscription fees. 

Over time, using these ALJs as the innovation engine we will build out [[action-learning infrastructure]]: distributed means of participating in and building capacity around action-learning journeys. This is to work towards a platform where these events organise themselves and people work in a distributed manner on bioregional transition pathways. All capacities and resourcing is organised and accounted for in a decentralised manner by leveraging these underlying patterns we're working on.

# Roadmap

In summary, although each order is, to some extent, active simultaneously, we are focussing on the orders of system actualisation sequentially, in the following years:

1. Case studies: 2025+
2. Incubation: 2026-2028+
3. Ecosystem: 2028-2030+
## Case-studies as Developmental Accounts
In order to on-board [[hubs]] into self-organising and self-[[publishing]] capacity, prisma is first manually organising and facilitating several [[action-learning journeys]] to build internal capabilities for effective distributed system design. 

This is also the period in which to generate clarity and cohesion of the core underlying patterns that are most relevant in publishing developmental accounts of [[action-learning]]:

1. Mapping - making visible the network hub and the future events being potentialised
2. [[Publishing]] - making the learnings generated during the action-learning journey available to a broader audience
3. [[Action-learning journeys]]
4. On-the-ground practitioners (aka fellows) - those who are stewarding the alignment between ALJ organising and place-sourced potential
5. [[a. Introduction|Place-in-practice]] and [[Enactment|Practice-in-place]] - the challenge of working with such large systems as an evolving community of practice and communities of place, and how they interrelate to co-evolve together, through hotspots of activity where transformation can occur. 

Therefore, by the end of this year, we are aiming to have generated the internal clarity of these concepts needed to be able to deliver on the promise of one published case-study per ALJ event. Required for this, we will be developing interfaces for the four core processes that is the organising pattern we bring to each ALJ: 

1. [[a. Introduction|Evaluation]]:
