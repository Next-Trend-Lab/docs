# Stakeholders and Growth Strategy
2025 will see the delivery of the [Accra action-learning journey](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/131867), the start of the [[Regenesis]] Story of Place programme, and potentially a few other exciting collaborations. 

The image above shows the same underlying pattern of event organising, which applies four [[Core Processes]].

In all the [[action-learning journeys]] (ALJs), we are aiming to form one or multiple action-learning teams that work on-the-ground on the development and application of an instrument (tooling). 

Each ALJ also generates content: videos, interviews, call recordings, wikis, art works. This content is curated by the [[communities of place]] to publish case-studies of the process. 

These case studies are developmental learning journeys: each with levels of depth. Our business model centres around the subscription to these journeys to access the depth. Each event is a catalyst for the ongoing *storying* of the work.

Over time, using these ALJs as the innovation impulse, the engine driving creation, we can build out action-learning infrastructure. This is to work towards a platform where these events organise themselves and people work in a distributed manner on bioregional transitions toward regenerative pathways. All capacities and resourcing is organised and accounted for in a decentralised manner by leveraging these underlying patterns we're working on.
