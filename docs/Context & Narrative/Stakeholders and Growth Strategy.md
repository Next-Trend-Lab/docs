# Stakeholders and Growth Strategy
2025 will see the delivery of the [Accra action-learning journey](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/131867), the start of the [[Regenesis]] Story of Place programme, and potentially a few other exciting collaborations. 

The image above shows the same underlying pattern of event organising, which applies four [[Core Processes]].

during each ALJs, one or multiple action-learning guilds (crews) form around the incubation of an instrument (tooling). during yr 1, we aim for the level of products (apps and/or features). regenesis is our client, and that gives us a direction and constraint to work with: image attached. we can allocate funding to each event for a given product spec, where defining that spec is part of the on-boarding. funding distribution is conditional on build requirements being met. in yr 2 we could aim to incubate DAOs, in yr 3/4, bioregional activation (regional DAO networks). 

each ALJ generates content: videos, interviews, call recordings, wikis, art works. this content can be curated by the communities to publish case-studies of the process. This is also part of the deliverable to Regenesis. These case studies are developmental learning journeys. Developmental is key. There are levels of depth. Our business model centres around the subscription to these journeys to access the depth. (it's also a knowledge safeguarding tactic) Hopefully each event is a catalyst for the ongoing storying of their work, so there is a reason for the subscription model.

Over time, using these ALJs as the innovation impulse, the engine driving creation, we can build out action-learning infrastructure. This is to work towards a platform where these events organise themselves and people work in a distributed manner on bioregional transitions toward regenerative pathways. All capacities and resourcing is organised and accounted for in a decentralised manner by leveraging these underlying patterns we're working on.
