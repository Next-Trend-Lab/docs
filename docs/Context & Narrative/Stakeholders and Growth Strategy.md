Here, we introduce the diverse stakeholders involved and outline your growth strategy for scaling impact.

- **Stakeholders**:
  - Participants (change agents in training)
  - Technology partners (Web3, DAO innovators)
  - Communities of practice (regenerative design, decolonial futures)
  - Local communities and bioregional hubs (where impact is grounded)
- **Growth Strategy**:
  - "Our goal is to scale by expanding the number of bioregional hubs and innovation intensives globally, creating a decentralized network of learning laboratories."
