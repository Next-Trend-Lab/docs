# The Renewable Energy Sector: Confronting Systemic Constraints

My journey began in the renewable energy sector. I was driven by a deep passion to combat climate change, convinced that renewable energy could be a transformative solution. But it didn’t take long before I began to see the cracks in this belief. Despite the promise of sustainability, I found myself trapped within the same patterns that had created the very problems we were trying to solve. Large organizations were constrained by rigid hierarchies and profit motives. Smaller firms struggled to compete, as monopolies and the corporate-political complex shaped the market.

I realized that even within the renewable energy space, we were working within a limited paradigm—one that treated the symptoms but never addressed the systemic root causes. I saw a lack of imagination and future-seeing. Mainstream media and traditional education systems stifled collective sense-making and disengaged people from shaping their own futures. It became clear that I needed to move beyond a market-based approach if I wanted to engage with real systems change.

# Business Incubator: A Turning Point Toward Community-Based Approaches

Still, I wasn’t ready to give up on entrepreneurial solutions just yet. I joined a business incubator program, hoping that innovation and market-based approaches could lead to transformative change. But what I encountered was more of the same: a narrow focus on competition, profit, and commodification of nature. There was little space for systems thinking, and even less for community-based approaches.

This experience was a turning point—a complete U-turn for me. I realized that trying to create systemic change from within the same neoliberal capitalist logic would only replicate the problems. It was at this point I began to shift toward community-based approaches to systems change, where the focus was on collaboration, collective wisdom, and building regenerative ecosystems from the ground up.

# Restoration and Nature-Based Solutions: Still Operating Within Legacy Systems

I explored new fields like restoration, nature-based solutions, and multi-capital accounting. These approaches seemed to offer a way to direct capital toward increasing environmental health. But again, I found these efforts were often absorbed into legacy systems with extractive, life-taking mindsets. The frameworks were still largely mechanistic and siloed, driven by infinite growth models of private accumulation.

What was needed was a complete paradigm shift—a new way of thinking and organizing that transcended the structures of extraction and separation.

# The Decentralization and Web3 Space: Discovering New Possibilities

It wasn’t until I entered the decentralization and Web3 space that I began to see the full potential for real systems change. The design space offered by DAOs, digital currency systems, self-sovereign identities, and collaborative finance structures opened up a horizon of possibilities where new governance systems could emerge, free from the constraints of legacy institutions.

One specific experience deepened this realization. I helped organize and attended a 10-day summit in Costa Rica with the ambitious goal of converting an eco-resort into a DAO. The first day opened with a one-hour monologue—a presentation of ideas, top-down, with no dialogue or facilitation. By the last day, we ended where we began, with another one-hour monologue, repeating much of the same thinking.

The learning was clear: without facilitation, blockages in thinking and communication can stifle dynamism and real development. This experience underlined a crucial insight—systemic change requires facilitation to unblock stuck points and allow for collective, emergent solutions to take shape. That’s why facilitation is one of the core capacities I now bring to events, along with place-sourcing design and technology innovation. Together, these capacities create the space for human systems to evolve in ways that are more fluid, adaptive, and regenerative.

# Embodying Regenerative Practices in Community

Ultimately, my journey led me to the ground—to real communities, working to embody non-monetary value systems. It was here, in place-based work, that I began to understand the deep importance of ecological wisdom, rootedness, and the values of community over individualism. I realized that technological innovation, while exciting, was only a tool—it couldn’t be the foundation of regenerative systems. True transformation required reconnecting to the wisdom of the land, the deep cultural knowledge of how humans can live in harmony with nature.

What struck me most was the balance between imagination and action. I learned that heart-centred wisdom—values of care, trust, and reciprocity—must be integrated with mind-centerd innovation. The future isn’t about choosing between ancient wisdom and new technologies; it’s about weaving them together in a way that respects the deep roots of community values while creating space for creative, emergent solutions.

My mission now is clear: to support communities in developing and enacting their own sovereign narratives for regenerative futures. By integrating both innovation and wisdom, we can create the conditions where communities chart their own course toward thriving bioregional ecosystems. This work is about fostering the capacities needed for people to imagine, experiment, and live into life-affirming futures—rooted in place, grounded in collective wisdom, and powered by both heart and mind.
