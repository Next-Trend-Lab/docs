Prisma undertakes process design from a living systems paradigm, inquiring into system dynamics from different perspectives in order to design interventions that contribute toward increasing vitality of these life processes. Our speciality is crafting [[Collaborative Innovation Intensives]].

Prisma is a collective of individual contributors, who dynamically form context-informed teams based on resonance in time and alignment of purpose. 

Our work is characterised by the integration of facilitation, place-sourcing design, and technology innovation.
