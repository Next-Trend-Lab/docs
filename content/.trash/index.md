# Patterns
## Introduction
Patterns form the foundational grammar of the Prisma system, enabling communities to self-organize, evolve governance structures, and activate regionally-informed practice-economies. By working with patterns, we cultivate the conditions for place-based and practice-driven transformation, allowing for coherent scaling of decentralized systems.

The Patterns folder documents key structures that support self-organizing capacities, helping participants, hubs, and networks coordinate action, evaluate outcomes, and iterate on regenerative practices.
## Why Work with Patterns?
Patterns act as recurring structures of relational intelligenceâ€”frameworks that allow ecosystems to self-express, adapt, and generate shared value. In Prisma, patterns are used to:

- Guide system-wide learning and iteration.
- Bridge local actions with global transformations.
- Enable mutual recognition and exchange of contributions.
- Support multi-scale governance and economic self-determination.

## Core Pattern Documents
Below are the key conceptual structures within the Prisma system:
### 1. Action-Learning Journeys (ALJs)
A structured process for co-designing systemic change through intensive in-person collaboration and iterative evaluation. ALJs activate communities in mapping, enacting, and evaluating regenerative economic structures.
### 2. Action-Learning
The underlying methodology that guides continuous system adaptation. Action-learning facilitates peer-to-peer knowledge production, iterative governance experimentation, and emergent coordination mechanisms.
### 3. Case-Studies
Each ALJ produces a case-study, a living record of place-sourced economic and governance innovation. Case-studies function as interfaces for knowledge commoning, funding alignment, and system visibility.
### 4. Aspects
Aspects represent the dimensions of systemic capacity-building, such as networking, financing, law relations, land relations, and youth engagement. Each aspect makes visible a particular facet of transformation, measured through practice-currencies.
### 5. Decentralized Organizing
A set of governance and coordination patterns that support self-organized, peer-led incubations of DAOs, practice-currency systems, and regenerative economic structures. Decentralized organizing ensures scalable, resilient system evolution.
