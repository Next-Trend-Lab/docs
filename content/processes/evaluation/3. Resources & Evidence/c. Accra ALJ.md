# **Case Study: The Accra Action Learning Journey**

The Accra ALJ serves as a powerful real-world example of our evaluation methodology in action. It demonstrates how we move from co-creating a value framework to tracking emergent dynamics and finally, to enabling resource allocation based on transparent, evidence-based insights.

## **Phase 1 in Action: The "Valuing Workshop" & Co-Creation**

The evaluation process began with a live, participatory **"Valuing Workshop"** during the first week. Instead of imposing a predefined framework, facilitators guided participants to surface what they considered valuable.

1. **Brainstorming Value:** Participants listed activities and states they valued, resulting in a rich list including `human connections`, `collaboration`, `creativity`, and `upskilling`.
    
2. **Thematic Grouping:** Facilitators worked with the group to cluster these items into four core value themes that would become the foundation of the evaluation:
    
    - **Social Relationality:** Fostering trust, openness, and collaboration.
        
    - **Learning & Application:** Enabling personal and collective growth.
        
    - **Creativity:** Activating imaginative potential for new ideas.
        
    - **Productivity:** Encouraging meaningful participation and tangible contribution.
        
3. **Co-Creating Weights:** The most critical step was determining the relative importance of these themes. Through a facilitated dialogue, the cohort decided on a weighting system that reflected their collective priorities for the journey. **The final agreed-upon weights were:**
    
    - **Social Relationality: 4x** (Recognized as the foundational element for all other value).
        
    - **Learning & Application: 3x**
        
    - **Creativity: 2x**
        
    - **Productivity: 1x**
        

This co-creative process ensured the evaluation framework was not an external imposition but a genuine reflection of the community's values.

## **Phase 2 in Action: The Schema Design & Tracking Process**

To track contributions against these four value areas, we designed four distinct **Telegram bot schemas**. The initial plan for participants to self-tag all entries proved "wildly unrealistic," so we pivoted to these high-gravity schemas for logging the most significant contributions.

- **Social Relationality Schema:** Designed to feel conversational. `â€˜When I felt stuck, @Zara sat with me.â€™ #support #gratitude` Verified by an emoji from the tagged person.
    
- **Learning Application Schema:** Formatted as a progress log. `@Jay #learning before: â€˜mumbled ideasâ€™ after: â€˜pitched clearlyâ€™ method: â€˜feedback from @Anuâ€™` Verified by a peer comment.
    
- **Creativity Schema:** A playful, "mad-lib" format. `@Leah dropped a #creativity bomb: â€˜What if we could track energy by measuring voice memo tempo?â€™ #idea` Verified by 3+ 'ðŸš€' reactions.
    
- **Productivity Schema:** An operational, checklist style. `@Ravi [#productivity #organizer] - [x] Finalized venue - [x] Coordinated speakers` Verified by a 'âœ…' from a facilitator.
    

While adoption was inconsistent, these schemas provided a crucial channel for capturing high-quality value signals that went beyond general chat messages.

## **Phase 3 in Action: Final Weighting for Prize Distribution**

The evaluation process culminated in the **enabling of resource allocation**â€”specifically, the distribution of the prize money. This was not a subjective decision by facilitators but a direct outcome of the data collected and weighted according to the framework the cohort themselves had built.

1. **Data Synthesis:** All verified contributions logged via the schemas, alongside facilitator observations and peer evaluation form data, were aggregated.
    
2. **Applying the Weights:** Each contribution was multiplied by its corresponding value weight (Social x4, Learning x3, etc.).
    
3. **Calculating Final Scores:** The weighted scores were tallied for each individual and team to create a final ranking.
    
4. **Transparent Distribution:** The prize money was distributed based on these final, transparent, and co-created evaluation scores, directly linking recognized value contribution to material reward.
    

**Conclusion:** The Accra ALJ demonstrates the power of our methodology to transform evaluation from a top-down assessment into a bottom-up process of valuing, tracking, and stewarding the flows of energy that catalyze regenerative change.
