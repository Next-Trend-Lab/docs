# **Templates & Guides: A Toolkit for Participatory Practice**

This is our library of practical, field-tested resources for implementing our evaluation methodology. These templates and guides provide the structure needed for a rigorous process while maintaining the flexibility required for contextual adaptation. They are designed to be used in participatory settings, empowering communities to become co-creators of their own evaluation framework.

## **Resources for Phase 1: Identifying Value**

- **Multi-Capital Mapping Canvas:** A collaborative Miro/Mural template to guide stakeholders in identifying, defining, and prioritizing the forms of capital most relevant to their context.
    
- **Aspect Development Canvas:** A structured worksheet for facilitating the co-creation of 5-7 key "Aspects" (valued activities) and their observable indicators.
    
- **Five Spheres Baseline Guide:** A set of narrative prompts to help communities document the starting conditions across the cultural, social, economic, political, and ecological spheres.
    

## **Resources for Phase 2: Tracking Catalysts**

- **Daily Reflection Prompts:** A list of curated morning intention and evening reflection questions designed to elicit insights on capital flows. _(e.g., "What was the most valuable exchange you experienced today? Who contributed meaningfully to your work?")_
    
- **Peer Capital Attribution Card:** A simple digital or physical template for participants to acknowledge value received from others, specifying the capital type and its impact.
    
- **Contribution Schema Guide:** A one-page guide explaining how to use the Telegram bot schemas for logging contributions across Social Relationality, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity.
    

## **Resources for Phase 3: Enabling Stewardship**

- **Collective Sense-Making Workshop Agenda:** A detailed, timed agenda for a 90-minute workshop that includes activities like a "Data Walk" (exploring visualizations), "Pattern Harvesting," and "Framework Refinement."
    
- **Evolution Narrative Template:** A story-based structure to guide the synthesis of evaluation data into a compelling narrative of a team's or project's developmental arc.
    
- **Adaptation Dialogue Framework:** A set of powerful questions to guide conversations that translate evaluation insights into concrete decisions about future actions and resource allocation.
