**Deep Dive: The Accra ALJ Evaluation Case Study**

Welcome to the Accra Action Learning Journey (ALJ) case study. This folder provides a detailed, transparent walkthrough of our evaluation methodology in action, documenting the journey from the live co-creation of values to the final, evidence-based distribution of resources.

The Accra ALJ is a powerful real-world example because it showcases our ability to not only design a robust evaluation framework but also to adapt it in real-time to the complex, emergent dynamics of a live event. It serves as concrete proof of how our process moves beyond simple measurement to become a catalyst for learning, collaboration, and fair stewardship.

## **What You'll Find Inside**

This folder contains two core documents that break down our work in Accra.

1. **[The Evaluation Process: A Living Practice](obsidian://open?vault=New&file=content%2Fprocesses%2Fevaluation%2F3.%20Resources%20%26%20Evidence%2Fc.%20Accra%20ALJ%20Case%20Study%2Fc.%20Accra%20ALJ%20Valuation)**  
    This page details the **'how' and 'why'** of our approach in Accra. It covers the foundational "Valuing Workshop" where participants co-created the value criteria and weighting, the live adaptation of our data collection methods (pivoting from general timelining to high-gravity schemas), and the multi-source data strategy that integrated forms, voice notes, and timeline entries. This process demonstrates the application of our structured rubrics in a dynamic, participatory setting.
    
2. **[The Individual & Team Rankings: From Data to Decision](obsidian://open?vault=New&file=content%2Fprocesses%2Fevaluation%2F3.%20Resources%20%26%20Evidence%2Fc.%20Accra%20ALJ%20Case%20Study%2Fd.%20Accra%20ALJ%20Sponsorships)**  
    This page outlines the **'what' and 'so what'** of the evaluation. It details the rigorous synthesis of all collected data, showing how we used our analytical tools and Jupyter notebooks to create visualizations and statistical summaries. Here you will find the transparent, step-by-step methodology for calculating the final weighted scores and how this data directly enabled a fair and accountable resource allocation.
    

## **Why This Case Study Matters**

The Accra ALJ is more than just an example; it is evidence of our core principles at work. It demonstrates:

- **Co-Creation in Action:** It shows how our participatory process for defining value and weights leads to legitimate, community-owned outcomes.
    
- **The Power of Adaptation:** It highlights our ability to adapt our methodology in real-time, responding to the practical challenges of data collection in a live environment.
    
- **Multi-Perspectival Rigor:** It provides concrete proof of how synthesizing diverse data types—from qualitative voice notes to quantitative form ratings—creates a more holistic and fair assessment than any single method could achieve.
    
- **Evaluation as a Catalyst:** Ultimately, this case study proves that our evaluation framework can be a direct and transparent tool for enabling stewardship and resource allocation, closing the loop from insight to action.
