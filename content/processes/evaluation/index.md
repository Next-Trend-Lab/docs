# **Evaluation: A Catalyst for Regenerative Value Flow**

Welcome to the Evaluation folder. Our approach to evaluation moves beyond traditional measurement and reporting. We see evaluation as a core process for **enabling greater value generation and flow towards the factors that exponentiate regenerative systems catalysis.**

Our framework is not static; it is a dynamic, participatory process designed to help communities, teams, and networks see, understand, and direct value where it matters most.

## **Our Core Mandate**

We accomplish this through a three-phase process designed to make complex systems legible and actionable:

1. **Identifying Value:** We work with partners to define what value means in their unique context. We establish baselines and co-create frameworks that honor both global best practices and local wisdom.
    
2. **Tracking Catalysts:** We use a multi-source approach—combining diverse data like voice notes, structured forms, and peer feedback—to track not just outcomes, but the _deltas, sources, and catalysts_ of change. Our relational indexing maps the intricate web of contributions and influences.
    
3. **Enabling Stewardship:** Our ultimate goal is to empower better stewardship. By making value flows transparent and weighting contributions based on their catalytic potential, we enable more effective resource allocation and create tight feedback loops for continuous learning and system evolution.
