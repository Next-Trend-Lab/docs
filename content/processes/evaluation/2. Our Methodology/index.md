# **Our Methodology: How We Catalyze Value**

Welcome to our methodology. This is the operational engine that brings our philosophy to life. Where our **Approach** explains the 'Why', our Methodology details the 'How'â€”the structured, participatory, and adaptive process we use to make regenerative value flows visible, trackable, and actionable.

Our methodology is not a rigid set of rules but a dynamic, living practice designed to work _with_ the complexity of living systems, not against it. It unfolds across three core phases, each designed to build upon the last in a continuous cycle of learning and evolution.

## **The Three Phases of Our Methodology**

This section is organized around the three core phases of our work. Each page provides a detailed look into the purpose, activities, and outcomes of that stage.

1. **[Phase 1: Identifying Value](obsidian://open?vault=New&file=content%2Fprocesses%2Fevaluation%2F2.%20Our%20Methodology%2Fa.%20Identifying%20Value)**  
    We begin by co-creating a shared understanding of what value means in a specific context, establishing the initial conditions and focus for our evaluation.
    
2. **[Phase 2: Tracking Catalysts](obsidian://open?vault=New&file=content%2Fprocesses%2Fevaluation%2F2.%20Our%20Methodology%2Fb.%20Tracking%20Catalysts)**  
    We then use a multi-source, real-time approach to track the flow of value, identifying the key interactions, contributions, and events that catalyze systemic change.
    
3. **[Phase 3: Enabling Stewardship](obsidian://open?vault=New&file=content%2Fprocesses%2Fevaluation%2F2.%20Our%20Methodology%2Fc.%20Enabling%20Stewardship)**  
    Finally, we close the loop by transforming insight into action, creating transparent feedback systems that enable more effective resource allocation and empower adaptive governance.
    

Together, these phases form a powerful learning cycle that moves beyond passive measurement to actively enhance the regenerative capacity of the communities and systems we serve.
