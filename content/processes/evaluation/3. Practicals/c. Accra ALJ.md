Based on the evaluation methodology outlined in your documents, I've designed a comprehensive evaluation package for the Accra Action-Learning Journey (ALJ) that tracks both the progression of events and the corresponding evaluation stages.

## Evaluation Timeline & Progression Framework

The table below maps the Accra ALJ events alongside the evaluation stages, showing how the evolutionary picture develops throughout the journey:

|Timeline|ALJ Event|Evaluation Stage|Evaluation Activities|Evolutionary Picture Development|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Pre-Journey|Interviews|Baselining|- Initial context mapping  <br>- Stakeholder identification  <br>- Local cultural practices assessment|- Preliminary understanding of local capitals  <br>- Initial mapping of systemic spheres|
|Week 1|Enrollment Call 1|Baselining|- Multi-capital concept introduction  <br>- Baseline values assessment  <br>- Capital dictionary co-creation|- Priority capitals identified  <br>- Cultural sphere baseline narrative drafted|
|Week 2|Enrollment Call 2|Baselining|- Aspect identification  <br>- Prioritization of key activities  <br>- Indicator co-creation|- Aspect-capital matrix developed  <br>- Social and economic sphere baselines drafted|
|Week 3|Enrollment Call 3|Baselining|- Progression scale development  <br>- Sustainability norms co-creation  <br>- Evaluation roles allocation|- Complete baseline across all five spheres  <br>- Evaluation framework finalized|
|Day 1-2|Intensive Start|Reading|- Bot configuration  <br>- Morning/evening reflection cycles  <br>- Initial capital flow tracking|- First patterns of capital flows emerging  <br>- Early insights on team dynamics|
|Day 3-4|Community Excursion (Dream Village)|Reading|- Place-based reflections  <br>- Cross-context comparisons  <br>- Field observation prompts|- Natural capital flows visualized  <br>- Cultural-ecological connections mapped|
|Day 5|Evaluation Day|Reading/Inferencing|- Mid-program sense-making  <br>- Pattern recognition workshop  <br>- Framework refinement|- Capital flow network visualization  <br>- Adaptation recommendations identified|
|Day 6-10|Hacking Days|Reading|- Continuous capital flow tracking  <br>- Daily reflection cycles  <br>- Team capital flow mapping|- Technical-social capital integration patterns  <br>- Innovation-related capital flows identified|
|Day 11|Presentation Day|Inferencing|- Capital flow insights integration  <br>- Holistic outcome articulation  <br>- Value generation storytelling|- Complete capital flow maps  <br>- Cross-sphere evolution patterns identified|
|Post-Journey|Follow-up & Reflection|Inferencing|- Retrospective workshops  <br>- System adaptation dialogues  <br>- Documentation of learnings|- Full evolutionary narrative across spheres  <br>- Long-term impact pathways identified|

## Implementation Details

## Baselining Phase Tools

1. **Multi-Capital Mapping Canvas**
    
    - Co-created during enrollment calls
        
    - Identifies which capitals (social, natural, human, etc.) are most relevant to Accra context
        
    - Establishes baseline conditions across the five spheres
        
2. **Aspect Development Framework**
    
    - Focuses on waste diversion initiatives mentioned in the document
        
    - Connects community storytelling to cultural capital flows
        
    - Maps microbusiness development to economic capital
        
3. **Sustainability Norms Document**
    
    - Collaboratively defines what "enough" looks like for each indicator
        
    - Establishes progression metrics on -3 to +3 scale
        
    - Contextualizes norms to Ghanaian cultural and economic realities
        

## Reading Phase Implementation

1. **Telegram Bot Configuration**
    
    - Triple-tag structure: #aspect/capital/direction
        
    - Example: #collaboration/social/generated
        
    - Voice journaling capability for participants with limited typing access
        
2. **Daily Reflection Prompts**
    
    - Morning: "What capitals do you hope to generate during today's activities in Accra?"
        
    - Evening: "How did your experiences at Dream Village transform your understanding of natural capital?"
        
    - Activity-specific: "What forms of capital flowed during the community storytelling session?"
        
3. **Capital Flow Visualization Dashboard**
    
    - Real-time network visualization showing capital exchanges between participants
        
    - Heatmap of capital intensity across different aspects
        
    - Timeline view showing evolution throughout the journey
        

## Inferencing Phase Components

1. **Collective Sense-Making Workshop Guide**
    
    - Data walk protocol for exploring visualization outputs
        
    - Pattern harvesting activities for identifying emergent themes
        
    - Cross-pollination exercises connecting insights across different teams
        
2. **Evolution Narrative Template**
    
    - Structure for documenting the developmental arc across all five spheres
        
    - Framework for connecting individual stories to systemic patterns
        
    - Method for identifying leverage points for future intervention
        
3. **Adaptation Dialogue Framework**
    
    - Protocol for translating insights into action
        
    - Process for refining the evaluation approach based on experience
        
    - Structure for identifying next steps in the regenerative development of Accra
        

This evaluation package makes visible the flows of multiple forms of capital throughout the Accra ALJ, revealing how waste diversion initiatives, community storytelling, and microbusiness development contribute to regenerative outcomes across cultural, social, economic, political, and ecological spheres.
