# Practicals: Implementing the Evaluation Framework

Welcome to the Practicals section of our evaluation methodology. While the Orientation materials introduced you to the conceptual foundations of our approach, these documents provide the hands-on tools, templates, and examples needed to put the framework into action.

## Purpose of This Section

The Practicals folder serves as your implementation toolkit, offering concrete resources for:

1. Facilitating the co-creation of evaluation frameworks with communities
    
2. Accessing ready-to-use templates for different stages of the evaluation process
    
3. Learning from a real-world implementation example (Accra ALJ)
    

These materials transform abstract concepts into tangible practices, enabling you to confidently implement our regenerative evaluation approach in diverse contexts.

## What You'll Find Inside

**Co-Creation Guide**: A step-by-step handbook for facilitating the collaborative development of evaluation frameworks with communities. This guide walks you through the enrollment calls, workshop activities, and facilitation techniques that enable stakeholders to define what value means in their context and how it should be measured.

**Templates & Assets**: A comprehensive collection of practical tools including baselining canvases, reflection forms, attribution templates, and workshop agendas. These ready-to-use resources save you time while ensuring consistency in your evaluation practice.

**Accra ALJ Example**: A detailed case study of how our evaluation methodology was implemented in the Accra Action-Learning Journey. This real-world example illustrates how the framework adapts to a specific context, with a timeline showing the progression of events alongside evaluation activities.

## How to Use These Resources

These practical resources are designed to be adapted rather than rigidly applied. We recommend:

1. Start by reviewing the Accra ALJ example to understand how the framework comes to life in practice
    
2. Use the Co-Creation Guide to plan your engagement with stakeholders
    
3. Adapt the Templates & Assets to fit your specific context and needs
    

Remember that effective evaluation is both structured and flexible-these resources provide the structure, while your facilitation brings the necessary adaptability to honor local context.

## The Living Practice of Evaluation

These practical tools embody our commitment to evaluation as a living practice that evolves through implementation. They draw inspiration from participatory methodologies like the Most Significant Change technique, the MultiCapital Scorecard approach, and Developmental Evaluation principles.

By organizing your evaluation work using these resources, you create a structured yet adaptable process that makes visible the flows of multiple forms of capital throughout your action-learning journey. The documents in this folder help you transform evaluation from a mechanical exercise into a dynamic practice of listening to the pulse of living systems.

We invite you to use, adapt, and evolve these practical resources as you implement our evaluation methodology in your unique context.
