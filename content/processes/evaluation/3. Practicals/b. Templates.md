# Templates & Assets

Our evaluation framework is supported by a suite of practical templates and assets designed to make the co-creation process accessible and effective. These resources provide structure while allowing for contextual adaptation, ensuring that evaluation remains both rigorous and relevant to the specific community.

## Baselining Canvases

- **Cross-Context Comparison**: Framework for comparing different environments
    
- **Embodied Learning**: Questions about physical and experiential dimensions
    
- **Cultural Immersion**: Reflections on cultural context and its influence
    

## Attribution/Peer-Recognition Templates

## Peer Capital Attribution Card

Digital or physical card for acknowledging value received from others:

- **Recipient Field**: Who provided the value
    
- **Capital Type**: What form of capital was shared
    
- **Aspect Connection**: Which valued activity this relates to
    
- **Impact Description**: How this contribution made a difference
    
- **Intensity Scale**: 1-5 rating of the significance of the contribution
    

## Team Capital Flow Tracker

Collaborative document for tracking capital flows within teams:

- **Team Member Matrix**: Grid showing exchanges between team members
    
- **Capital Type Coding**: Color-coding system for different forms of capital
    
- **Weekly Summary**: Space for synthesizing patterns and insights
    
- **Adaptation Ideas**: Section for suggesting ways to enhance capital flows
    

## Community Attribution Network

Visual tool for mapping capital flows across the broader community:

- **Network Visualization**: Interactive diagram showing connections
    
- **Capital Flow Arrows**: Directional indicators of value exchange
    
- **Intensity Weighting**: Visual representation of flow significance
    
- **Temporal View**: Option to see how flows change over time
    

## Sense-Making Workshop Agendas

## Mid-Program Evaluation Workshop (90 minutes)

Structured agenda for collective sense-making:

1. **Data Walk** (20 min): Exploring visualizations of capital flows
    
2. **Aspect Review** (20 min): Discussing relevance and patterns for each aspect
    
3. **Gap Identification** (15 min): Identifying missing elements in the framework
    
4. **Framework Refinement** (25 min): Adjusting the evaluation approach
    
5. **Role Reallocation** (10 min): Updating evaluation responsibilities
    

## Final Sense-Making Workshop (120 minutes)

Comprehensive agenda for synthesizing insights:

1. **Journey Timeline** (20 min): Mapping key moments and capital flows

3. **Sphere Evolution Dialogue** (25 min): Discussing changes across the five spheres
    
4. **Impact Storytelling** (30 min): Crafting narratives about value generation
    
5. **Future Adaptation** (20 min): Planning how to apply insights going forward
    

## Facilitator Debrief Template

Guide for evaluation team reflection:

1. **Process Review**: Assessing what worked and what didn't in the evaluation process
    
2. **Tool Effectiveness**: Evaluating the utility of different evaluation tools
    
3. **Insight Quality**: Reflecting on the depth and usefulness of generated insights
    
4. **Participation Patterns**: Analyzing engagement with the evaluation process
    
5. **Adaptation Recommendations**: Suggesting improvements for future iterations
    

These templates and assets provide a comprehensive toolkit for implementing our evaluation framework, offering enough structure to ensure consistency while remaining flexible enough to adapt to the unique context of each action-learning journey.
