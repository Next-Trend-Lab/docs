# **Our Approach: Evaluation as a Catalyst**

This section outlines the core philosophy and operational framework that guide our evaluation work. We move beyond conventional measurement to a practice that is participatory, dynamic, and directly in service of regenerative systems change.

Our approach is built on two core pillars, detailed in the pages within this section:

1. **Our Foundation: Beyond Measurement**  
    We begin with a fundamental shift in perspective: evaluation is not about assigning static scores, but about valuing the energy flows that create health and vitality in living systems. This shapes _what_ we look for and _why_.
    
2. **Our Framework: The Three-Phase Process for Catalysis**  
    We operationalize our philosophy through a dynamic, three-phase framework: **Identifying** potential, **Tracking** catalysts, and **Enabling** stewardship. This is _how_ we turn insight into actionable value flow.
    

By engaging with these materials, you will understand how we design and facilitate evaluation processes that honor complexity while delivering the clarity needed to catalyze systemic evolution.
