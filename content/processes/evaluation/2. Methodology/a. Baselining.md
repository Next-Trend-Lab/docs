# Stage 1: Baselining

## Purpose & Outcomes

Baselining is the foundational stage of our evaluation framework, establishing the initial understanding of systemic conditions before intensive engagement begins. This critical first step serves several key purposes:

1. To create a shared understanding of the current state across the five systemic spheres
    
2. To co-create the evaluation framework with stakeholders, ensuring it reflects local values and priorities
    
3. To identify key aspects and capitals that will be tracked throughout the journey
    
4. To establish benchmarks against which evolution can be measured
    

The primary outcomes of effective baselining include:

- A co-created "capital dictionary" specific to the context
    
- A set of 5-7 key aspects that will serve as focal points for evaluation
    
- Clear indicators and progression metrics for each aspect
    
- An evaluation team with defined roles and responsibilities
    
- Baseline narratives that capture the starting conditions across spheres
    

## Step-by-Step Process

## 1. Initial Context Mapping

Before the first enrollment call, facilitators conduct preliminary research to understand the local context, including:

- Reviewing existing documentation about the place and community
    
- Identifying key stakeholders and their relationships
    
- Understanding local cultural practices and values
    
- Mapping potential forms of capital relevant to the context
    

## 2. First Enrollment Call: Mapping Valued Capitals

The first call introduces participants to the multi-capital concept and begins the co-creation process:

- **Introduction to Multi-Capital Framework**: Present the concept of multiple forms of capital beyond financial (social, natural, human, etc.)
    
- **Baseline Values Assessment**: Facilitate activities where participants identify which capitals matter most in their context
    
- **Digital Capturing**: Use collaborative tools (e.g., Miro boards, shared documents) to document perspectives
    
- **Initial Prioritization**: Begin narrowing down which capitals will be most relevant to track
    

## 3. Second Enrollment Call: Defining Aspects and Activities

The second call focuses on identifying the specific activities and aspects that will be evaluation focal points:

- **Aspect Identification**: Facilitate discussion to identify specific activities that generate or transform capital
    
- **Prioritization Exercise**: Have participants vote on 5-7 key aspects that represent the most critical activities
    
- **Indicator Co-Creation**: For each selected aspect, collaboratively develop 2-3 observable indicators
    
- **Mapping Aspects to Capitals**: Create a matrix showing how each aspect relates to different forms of capital
    

## 4. Third Enrollment Call: Creating Progression Metrics and Roles

The final enrollment call establishes how progress will be measured and who will be responsible:

- **Progression Scale Development**: Introduce the concept of progression scoring (e.g., using a -3 to +3 scale)
    
- **Sustainability Norms Co-Creation**: Facilitate discussion about what "enough" looks like for each indicator
    
- **Evaluation Roles Allocation**: Identify participants interested in specific evaluation aspects and assign roles
    
- **Technical Demonstration**: Show how the evaluation tools (e.g., Telegram bot) will work in practice
    

## 5. Baseline Documentation

Following the enrollment calls, facilitators work with participants to document the baseline state:

- **Sphere Narratives**: Create descriptive narratives of the current state across the five spheres
    
- **Capital Flow Maps**: Document existing flows of capital within the system
    
- **Aspect Benchmarks**: Establish starting points for each aspect and indicator
    
- **System Visualization**: Create visual representations of the current system state
    

## Example Baseline Narratives and Tables

## Example: Cultural Sphere Baseline Narrative

_"The community of Accra currently demonstrates strong cultural capital in the form of traditional ecological knowledge, particularly around farming practices. However, there is a generational gap in knowledge transfer, with younger community members showing less engagement with these traditions. The dominant narrative around technology is that it represents 'progress' separate from traditional ways, rather than a potential complement to cultural practices. Community storytelling happens informally but lacks structured spaces for intergenerational exchange."_

## Example: Aspect Benchmark Table

|Aspect|Capital Type|Current State (-3 to +3)|Sustainability Norm|Indicators|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Knowledge Sharing|Human, Social|-1 (Limited structured sharing)|+2 (Regular, accessible knowledge exchange)|1. Frequency of documentation  <br>2. Quality of explanations  <br>3. Application by others|
|Community Collaboration|Social, Political|0 (Occasional collaboration)|+2 (Consistent, effective collaboration)|1. Cross-team initiatives  <br>2. Conflict resolution effectiveness  <br>3. Inclusive decision-making|
|Ecological Integration|Natural, Cultural|-2 (Minimal integration)|+3 (Fully regenerative practices)|1. Biodiversity impact  <br>2. Resource cycling  <br>3. Traditional knowledge application|

By establishing these baselines through a co-creative process, we ensure that the evaluation framework is both contextually relevant and owned by the community. This foundation enables meaningful tracking of capital flows and systemic evolution throughout the action-learning journey.
