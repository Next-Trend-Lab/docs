# Methodology

## The Living Practice of Evaluation

Our evaluation methodology represents a fundamental shift from traditional assessment approaches. Rather than focusing solely on outcomes or numerical data, we embrace evaluation as a living practice-a dynamic dialogue with the systems we seek to understand and nurture.

This methodology is designed to capture the essence of regenerative development: the flow of multiple forms of capital through complex systems. By making these often-invisible flows visible, we enable communities to learn, adapt, and evolve in harmony with place and purpose.

## Three-Stage Approach

Our methodology unfolds through three interconnected stages that form a continuous learning cycle:

1. **Baselining:** Establishing initial understanding of systemic conditions through co-creation
    
2. **Reading:** Capturing the dynamic pulse of capital flows during the journey
    
3. **Inferencing:** Synthesizing insights to inform future action and adaptation
    

This approach ensures that evaluation is not merely an afterthought but an integral part of the regenerative development process-informing action in real-time while building capacity for deeper systemic understanding.

## Methodological Foundations

Our approach draws inspiration from several complementary frameworks and practices:

- **The MultiCapital Scorecard** (Thomas & McElroy): Providing structure for defining capitals and progression metrics relative to context-specific sustainability norms
    
- **Developmental Evaluation** (Patton): Offering principles for evaluation in complex, emergent contexts where traditional linear approaches fall short
    
- **Most Significant Change** technique (Davies & Dart): Contributing story-based methods that capture qualitative dimensions of transformation
    
- **Five Capitals Model** (Forum for the Future): Illustrating how managing and enhancing multiple capitals supports regenerative outcomes
    
- **Warm Data Labs** (Bateson): Methodology for contextual inquiry that reveals relationships and interdependencies across systems
    

These influences are woven together with our own innovations in technology-enabled evaluation, creating a methodology that is both theoretically grounded and practically applicable.

## Distinctive Features

What distinguishes our methodology from conventional evaluation approaches:

- **Co-creation at every stage:** Communities define what matters, how it's measured, and what constitutes progress
    
- **Multi-capital lens:** Recognizing and valuing diverse forms of capital beyond the financial
    
- **Real-time feedback loops:** Enabling responsive adaptation throughout the journey
    
- **Technology-enabled participation:** Lowering barriers to engagement through accessible tools
    
- **Systems perspective:** Tracking evolution across five interconnected spheres (cultural, economic, social, political, ecological)
    

## Implementation Philosophy

This methodology is not a rigid prescription but a living framework that adapts to context. It embodies our core values of playfulness, curiosity, interdependence, and integrity-inviting communities to experiment, discover patterns, honor relationships, and measure what truly matters.

In the following sections, we detail each stage of the methodology, providing practical guidance for implementation while maintaining the flexibility necessary for contextual adaptation.
