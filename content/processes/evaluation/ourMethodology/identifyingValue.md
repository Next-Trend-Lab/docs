sidebarTitle: a. Identifying Value

# **Phase 1: Identifying Value**

## **Goal: From an abstract model to a co-created, contextual understanding of what value means _here_.**

Before we can track value, we must first define it in collaboration with the community we are serving. This foundational phase ensures our evaluation is relevant, owned by the stakeholders, and grounded in the realities of their place and purpose. It is where we collaboratively build the "playground" for evaluation.

## **Key Activities**

This phase typically unfolds through a series of facilitated, participatory workshops.

1. **Context Mapping & Initial Research**  
    We start by listening. Our team conducts preliminary research to understand the local context, mapping key stakeholders, cultural values, and potential forms of capital relevant to the project. This ensures we enter the conversation with respect and awareness.
    
2. **Co-Creating the "Capital Dictionary"**  
    In our first sessions, we introduce our Multi-Capital Framework as a starting point. Through interactive exercises, participants identify which capitals (e.g., Social, Natural, Cultural, Human) are most vital to their work. Together, we create a shared "dictionary" that defines these capitals in their own terms.
    
3. **Defining the Focal Points: Aspects & Indicators**  
    We then guide the group to identify 5-7 key **Aspects**â€”the critical activities or processes where value is generated (e.g., "Knowledge Sharing," "Community Collaboration"). For each Aspect, we collaboratively develop 2-3 observable **Indicators** that will signal progress.
    
4. **Establishing a Living Baseline**  
    Finally, we document the starting conditions. This is not a static snapshot, but a living baseline composed of:
    
    - **Sphere Narratives:** Rich descriptions of the current state across the five systemic spheres (Cultural, Economic, Social, Political, Ecological).
        
    - **Benchmark Tables:** A clear starting point for each Aspect and its indicators, often using a simple progression scale (e.g., -3 to +3) that the community defines.
        
## **Example: Aspect Benchmark Table**

|Aspect|Capital Types|Current State (-3 to +3)|Sustainability Norm (The Goal)|Key Indicators|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Knowledge Sharing**|Human, Social|-1|+2 (Regular, accessible)|1. Frequency of documentation  <br>2. Quality of explanations  <br>3. Peer application|
|**Community Collaboration**|Social, Political|0|+2 (Consistent, effective)|1. Cross-team initiatives  <br>2. Conflict resolution  <br>3. Inclusive decisions|
|**Ecological Integration**|Natural, Cultural|-2|+3 (Fully regenerative)|1. Biodiversity impact  <br>2. Resource cycling  <br>3. Use of local knowledge|

By the end of this phase, we have a co-owned evaluation framework that is deeply relevant to the local context and ready to track the flows of value that truly matter.
