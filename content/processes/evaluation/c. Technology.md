## **Technology**

Our e-valuation methodology leverages cutting-edge Web3 technologies and decentralized tools to create a robust, transparent, and participatory evaluation ecosystem. Here's an overview of the key technological components:

### **Core Infrastructure**

1. **Lu.ma**: 
   - Used for event registration and participant onboarding.
   - Integrates with our [DID System](DID System) for secure identity management.

2. **Telegram**:
   - **Chats**: Facilitate real-time communication and community engagement.
   - **Bots**: Automate data collection, contribution tracking, and peer recognition.

3. **Wiki Publishing Engine**:
   - A [Holochain](Holochain)-based platform for collaborative documentation of case studies and insights.
   - Enables decentralized knowledge commoning across [bioregions](bioregions).

4. **Smart Contracts & DAOs**:
   - Automate resource distribution and governance decisions.
   - Implement [Capital Distribution](Capital Distribution) protocols for transparent fund allocation.

### **Data Collection & Analysis**

1. **Voice and Written Journalling Analysis**:
   - AI-powered tools for sentiment analysis and pattern recognition in participant reflections.
   - Integrates with our [developmental evaluation](developmental evaluation) framework to capture qualitative insights.

2. **Product Development Submissions**:
   - Holochain-based [DID System](DID System) for tracking contributions and innovations.
   - Enables [Speech-to-Currency](Speech-to-Currency) conversion for recognizing value creation.

3. **Facilitator Reports**:
   - Structured data collection interfaces for [facilitator teams](facilitator teams).
   - Real-time synthesis of insights to inform adaptive management.

4. **Peer Reviews**:
   - Decentralized reputation systems for community-driven quality assurance.
   - Integrates with DAOs for participatory governance of evaluation criteria.

### **Proof Systems**

1. **Proof of Work**:
   - Tokenize participant contributions using [Speech-to-Currency](Speech-to-Currency) protocols.
   - Capture diverse forms of value creation beyond traditional metrics.

2. **Proof of Impact**:
   - Link outcomes to funding via [Capital Distribution](Capital Distribution) DAOs.
   - Enable real-time, transparent allocation of resources based on measurable impact.

### **Integration & Interoperability**

Our technology stack is designed for seamless integration with existing tools and emerging innovations:

- **API-First Architecture**: Enables easy connection with sensor networks, IoT devices, and external data sources.
- **Modular Design**: Allows for rapid iteration and incorporation of new tools as they emerge.
- **Open Standards**: Commitment to interoperability ensures our system can evolve with the broader Web3 ecosystem.
