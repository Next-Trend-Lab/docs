# What is timelining?
Timelining is the process of building up a timeline of an [action-learning journey](patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) (ALJ). Timelining uses multiple sources of data, and collects different kinds of action-led contributions. The basic premise is for it to be highly adaptable, catering to different cohorts' intentions, and different ALJ aims.
# Why
Each ALJ is an evolutionary process. Timelining is one way of making this visible. Making this visible serves learning. As when you journal to notice patterns in your thinking, cohorts can *timeline* (perform timelining) to notice patterns in their actions. In that way, timelining is how we aim to support the [incubation](home) of evolutionary organisations. 
# How
We do that by leveraging dedicated timelining topics in telegram groups, and picking up messages with a specific pattern. What makes this so adaptable is that you can identify a new perspective into the ALJ and create a new topic relatively easily. A pattern can also be prototyped with almost no additional functionality required. Here are two example, with a subtle but crucial difference.

<Tabs items={['Basic', 'Advanced']}> 
<Tabs.Tab>
A cohort decides they want to start keeping track of decisions. They decide they'd like to record the context, decision, and participants. The following pattern is used:

```json
{
	"context": "",
	"decision": "",
	"participants": []
}
```

Below is an example of the pattern in use. This could be a message to a telegram topic named `DecisionAccounting`.

```
Context: During the hackathon, multiple teams needed the same room for afternoon sessions, leading to confusion and overlap.,
Decision: Each morning, 2 participants will arrive early to the hub to set up the hybrid conferencing equipment in time for the first agenda item. Who, where, and when will be confirmed the night before.,
Participants: @sam, @jamila, @fernando
```

## The Difference

## Processing Messages
This tooling is set up for collective storytelling of [action-learning](patterns/action-learning.md). We want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to contribute to that story. At the same time, the simple telegram chat UI is backed onto a [serverless](https://vercel.com/) API, and writes to a [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database.
