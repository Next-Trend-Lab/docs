# **Ingest**

### **Top-level Directories:**
- **`src`**: Contains the core application logic.
  - **`api`**: Contains API endpoint logic for the webhook and worker.
  - **`lib`**: Holds libraries for Telegram interaction (`telegram.ts`), Redis management (`redis.ts`), and database (`neo4j.ts`, `entries.ts`, `participants.ts`).
  - **`scripts`**: Contains helper scripts for tasks like health checks, managing test environments, and other one-off processes.
  
- **`test`**: Contains test logic for the application.
  - **`test-env`**: Contains Docker configuration files and environment setups for running tests.
  - **`tests`**: Contains test files for the API and database.
  - **`scripts`**: Helper scripts used for testing, such as health checks and setup/teardown of Docker containers.

### **API Deployment:**
- **Vercel Functions**: The API is deployed as serverless functions on Vercel.
  - **API Endpoints**:
    1. **`webhook.ts`**: Triggered when the Telegram bot receives a new message. It:
       - Receives the message data, validates it, and writes it to an Upstash serverless Redis queue.
       - Sends a confirmation back to the chat via the Telegram Bot API.
       - Telegram and Redis logic are abstracted into `lib/telegram.ts` and `lib/redis.ts`, respectively.
    
    2. **`worker.ts`**: Triggered by a cron job managed by Vercel. It:
       - Processes the Redis queue, retrieving entries, and processing them.
       - Writes metadata to a Neo4j database (via `lib/neo4j.ts`, `lib/entries.ts`, `lib/participants.ts`).
       - Attaches media to BLOB storage (not implemented yet).
       - This script helps process data that the bot picks up on a scheduled basis.

### **Database:**
- **Neo4j**: Used to store and manage the application’s graph-based data (entries and participants).
  - The database logic is located in `src/lib/neo4j.ts`, with separate modules for managing entries (`entries.ts`) and participants (`participants.ts`).
  - **Entries**: Represent messages processed by the worker.
  - **Participants**: Represent users who send messages to the Telegram bot.

### **Testing:**
- **Jest**: Used for testing the application’s core logic, both for the API endpoints and the database interactions.
  - **API Tests**: Mocks third-party APIs like Telegram and Redis, testing the interaction between the endpoints and the system.
  - **Database Tests**: Use Docker to stand up a test instance of the Neo4j database. Tests include the creation of entries and participants.
  - Several helper scripts (`db:up`, `db:down`, `health-check.cjs`) were created to make the test environment setup and teardown more straightforward:
    - **`docker-compose.yml`**: Used to spin up the Neo4j test container.
    - **Health check script**: Ensures the database is ready before running tests.
  - **Test Data**: Data is currently deleted at the end of tests but the Docker volume can persist for inspection if desired.

### **Production Environment:**
- **Environment Variables**: Set in the Vercel dashboard for production configurations like the `BOT_TOKEN` and Neo4j connection credentials.
- **CI/CD**: Deployment happens on Vercel via GitHub integration. The `main` branch triggers deployment when code is pushed.
