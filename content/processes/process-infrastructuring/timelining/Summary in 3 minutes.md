Context
- We're prisma
- We organise action-learning journeys. At its most basic level an ALJ is an event. You can think of them as a facilitated hackathon that lasts multiple weeks and happens at the end of multiple months of alignment between stakeholders. It's a multi-disciplinary intensive. Every event is essentially an experiment in social technology. 
- We organise action-learning journeys. 
- The action is applying a given practice of systems-evolution - i.e. to design and implement a systemic intervention in place
- The learning is how thinking changes as theory is applied in the real world. Think of the difference between drills and sparring, training and match-day. 
- We have HUGE potential lined up: â‚¬20M kind of huge
- We work at the grassroots level, across a focussed but growing network of partner hubs, and we've bootstrapped the whole thing so far.
- We're moving forwards whether we get this grant or not because we need to. The grant means we can do it properly and share it with your community
- A big emphasis of our work is to embody processes of decentralised organising during our in-person intensives. There are many ways this can happen. We employ mostly sociocracy, so far. It's about truly activating the agency of every individual - in a group coordination exercise. This is totally transformational. 
	- E.g. A workshop was designed by one of our team on the way to a conference, here, in Barcelona. It lasted under an hour. Several months later, the same facilitator bumped into a participant of that workshop who told them that the workshop had literally changed their life. They took so many decisions on things they were previously blocked on.

So, why did we apply for funding for?
- In order to learn from these actions, we need to make visible not just the outcomes from these events but the approach. 
- We make these visible in a case-study. One per action-learning journey. 
- Yes, you can have networks of IoT sensors - digital MRV from the ReFi space, or DePIN, assessing "impact" - and we're going there, too. But, the learning that is most important important relates to how people evolve their view of the world. 
- Making visible the shifts in people's thinking is a challenge that has sunk many great systems-change efforts in the past, because the working radically (at the root) is difficult to see - you work with beliefs, and how people approach relating with each other
- So, we need an innovative approach to try and lift to the surface more of what usually stays hidden, personal, or implicit
