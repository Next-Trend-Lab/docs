# Solution
Prisma is a distributed action-learning incubator. We organise action-learning journeys to incubate action-learning teams that hack on local systems, proactively generating data to publish data-backed storytelling of future-oriented, whole-systems transition pathways. This work needs funding. Funding requires verification of real-world actions. We have developed and trialed a whole methodology to repeatedly create transformation-oriented events. Our last event was made possible by Catalyst, and took place in Accra, in Ghana, in partnership with Wada and Accra Resoure Centre. Now, with our organising and facilitation validated, we are building out the infrastructure needed for these events to organise themselves, and action verification is at its core - on Cardano.

As part of organising an action-learning journey, we facilitate local stakeholders to identify ecosystem health indicators, and co-design transaction protocols that generate verifiable data through agent-centric actions: input, execution, output. Each protocol is the foundation of a smart contract, where the user experience of working on evolving their regional systems is the basis of generating data about impact.
