# Intro
[action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) (ALJs) are a complex system. a [case-study](patterns/case-study.md) serves the purpose of communicating the particular nature of a given action-learning journey as well as the outcomes and what they mean for the communities involved. there are multiple forms of data being created throughout, at varying levels of detail and abstraction. therefore, a case-study is continually being created throughout and is itself a lived process. similarly, publishing is a case-study is therefore also an ongoing process - continually making available more data from the action-learning.

however, there are also certain procedures, such as running an analysis on a dataset, editing filming footage, conducting closure interviews, and collecting final contributions from teams, that are discrete and need to be done before the case-study can be considered complete. in that sense, the case-study can be considered officially "published" once these main items have all been added, and the end result is shared far and wide: social media, personal networks, and targeting institutions with a clear purpose such as attracting funding for a future ALJ or engaging communities of potential [subscribers](processes/process-infrastructuring/subscribing.md) who'd like to learn about what's involved in working on those systems.

a case-study is a living account of the work of evolving systems. subscriptions can... 

1. start before a case-study is considered officially published, seeing more of the potentialising process real-time, and 
2. can continue after an intensive and after a case-study is considered published, whilst teams and [hubs](collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md) continue deepening the work. 

the idea is for the audience to choose to subscribe to a given hub's ALJ as and when suits them. [action-learning journeys](patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) are about creating a space of radical experimentation. subscriptions to case-studies are the means for gaining access to real-time action-learning.
