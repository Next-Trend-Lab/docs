[action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) (ALJs) are a complex system. a [case-study](patterns/case-study.md) serves the purpose of communicating the learnings that are generated by an action-learning journey. as described in [case-study](patterns/case-study.md), there are multiple forms of data being created throughout, at varying levels of detail and abstraction. therefore, a case-study is continually being created throughout and is itself a lived process. similarly, publishing is a case-study is therefore also an ongoing process - continually making available more data from the action-learning.

however, there are also certain components, such as running an analysis on a dataset, editing filming footage, conducting closure interviews, and collecting final contributions from teams, that are discrete and need to be done before the case-study can be considered complete. in that sense, the case-study can be considered officially "published" once these main items have all been added, and the end result is shared far and wide - social media, personal networks, and targeting institutions with a clear purpose such as attracting funding for a future ALJ or engaging communities of potential [subscribers](processes/process-infrastructuring/subscribing.md) who'd like to learn about what's involved in working on those systems.
