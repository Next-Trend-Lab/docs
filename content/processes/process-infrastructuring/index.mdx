process-infrastructuring refers to facilitating the creation of a distributed system of [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md):

1. [enrolment](/processes/enrolment.md) includes...
	1. [registration](https://register.prisma.events): on-boarding pathways
	2. profiles & IDs
	3. multi-stakeholder alignment
2. [ground-potentialising](/processes/ground-potentialising.md) includes...
	1. infrastructure deployment (apps to dedicated sub-domains)
	2. [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md): mapping
	3. product vision development
3. [evaluating](/processes/evaluation) includes...
	1. value signalling (p2p): [practice-currencies](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies)
	2. event trajectory timeline: [timelining](processes/process-infrastructuring/timelining/index.md)
4. [enacting](/processes/enactment) includes...
	1. self-organising [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) participation
	2. network agreements
	3. agenda building

each interrelates to create the means for [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md) and [practice networks](/collaborators/communities%20of%20practice/practice%20networks.md) to jointly self-organise [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) and produce a [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md).
