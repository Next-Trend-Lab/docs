process-infrastructuring refers to facilitating the creation of a distributed system of <FeatureText text="ALJ" className="text-lg cursor-pointer" href="/patterns/action-learning%20journeys" />s:

1. [enrolment](/processes/enrolment.md) includes...
	1. [registration](https://register.prisma.events): on-boarding pathways
	2. profiles & IDs
	3. multi-stakeholder alignment
2. [ground-potentialising](/processes/ground-potentialising.md) includes...
	1. infrastructure deployment (apps to dedicated sub-domains)
	2. [hub](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs) mapping
	3. ALJ outcome vision development
	4. resource pooling
3. [evaluating](/processes/evaluation) includes...
	1. value signalling (p2p): [practice-currencies](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies)
	2. evolutionary trajectories: [timelining](/processes/process-infrastructuring/timelining)
	3. resource distribution
4. [enacting](/processes/enactment) includes...
	1. self-organising [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) participation
	2. agenda building
	3. decision-making

each interrelates to create the means for [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs) and [practice networks](/collaborators/communities-of-practice/practice-networks) to jointly self-organise [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) and produce a [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md).
