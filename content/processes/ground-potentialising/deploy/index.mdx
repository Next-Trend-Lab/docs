# DeployStack Orchestration UI — Technical Specification

> Note to reader: This is a real human being writing. No robots were harmed in the making.

## Context

We onboard people into [process-domains](/processes) (literal subdomains.prisma.events) for the organising and facilitation of [transformation-oriented events](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) in the [systems-change](/glossary/Place.md) space. 

![pg21](/pg21.png)

1. (ENROLMENT) — Event registration is facilitated by bespoke forms, co-designed with communities of place to enrol different stakeholder types into a multi-month alignment process. Forms are made in a [no-code form-builder](https://www.tally.so) for accessibility, but deployed on [event-specific infrastructure](https://register.prisma.events), with a [hub](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md) subscription, starting at [$20/mo](https://pitch.prisma.events/25).

2. (CASE) — Docs needs 

   a. your favourite markdown editor client like obsidian, //* list second brain apps *// for non-coders to write wiki, and 
   b. a reminder to "add custom JSX components to show live data in your [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files" for developers

3. ([EVALUATION](/processes/evaluation)) — [Timelining](/processes/process-infrastructuring/timelining) is p cool. We came last in a an ideathon organised by [singularitynet.io](https://www.singularitynet.io)'s [DeepFunding](https://blog.singularitynet.io/results-of-deep-funding-round-1-5aa37df06749) and then built it anyway because we needed it in [Accra](https://evaluate.prisma.events). 

4. ([ENACTION](/processes/enactment)) — Enact has a basic form -> to message queue -> to [list](https://enact.prisma.events) stack, which can be used to engage non-technical people in "contracts" (once we make it on-chain) - used for real-time governance (like what we try to incubate in an [ALJ](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md)). Think emergent learning, action-oriented... after several months of aligning multiple stakeholders at multiple levels of systems. 

5. ([POTENTIALISING](https://potentialise.prisma.events)) — Propagating that whole stack to a hub as a case-study publishing template/ scaffold, while being self-enclosed, relatively open-source, and driven by emergent learning, coming from on-the-ground action. As we're doing for [Nairobi](https://potentialise.prisma.events).


## Purpose

To build a minimal, elegant front-end interface for deploying a preconfigured suite of event-related applications (`register`, `docs`, `evaluation`, `enact`) using the Vercel and GitHub APIs. This app acts as a guide for configuring, provisioning, and deploying the full event stack on a client-specific domain.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS (black background, white content area)
- **State Management:** Zustand (ephemeral, in-session state)
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod (validation schema)
- **Deployment Targets:** Vercel (client-owned or partner-owned accounts)
- **Git Operations:** GitHub API (fork workflow only - no clone)
- **UI Patterns:** Multi-step progress with a top progress bar and full-screen staged layouts

## Workflow: 5 Stages, 5 Routes

Note: `ground_code` has been used to indicate [Hub](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md) unique identifier. 

1. **Metadata Collection**
   - Form to gather: client name, event name/date, and domain
   - Data stored client-side in Zustand store
   - Route: `/[ground_code]/1`

2. **GitHub Integration**
   - Form to connect GitHub account, to install Prisma Deploy GitHub App in their org, and enable permissions for Prisma (offering) to deploy one of our repos by a fork on their (receiving) behalf
   - Radio to select method: `fork` or `clone` (clone not implemented yet)
   - Token stored only in memory (no cookies), passed directly to backend on successful authentication
   - Route: `/[ground_code]/2`

3. **Vercel Integration**
   - Stage for deploying on Vercel by using Vercel API to connect their GitHub (additional permissions needed on bot) - not implemented yet
   - Token handled like GitHub’s — ephemeral in memory
   - Route: `/[ground_code]/3`

4. **App Marketplace**
   - Select from available prisma (example) apps (`register`, `docs`, `evaluation`, `enact`)
   - UI: Responsive cards with graphic, name, and "Selected" toggle state
   - Selected apps persisted in Zustand store
   - Route: `/[ground_code]/4`

5. **Deploy Stack**
   - Final confirmation screen
   - Displays summary of config + selected apps
   - User provides tokens again here (for single-use security)
   - Route: `/[ground_code]/5`
   - On "Deploy" click:
     - Backend runs orchestrated deploy routine: fork/clone, create repos, configure env vars, deploy to Vercel, return DNS config

## Zustand Store Schema

```ts
type DeployState = {
  metadata: Metadata;
  github: GithubInfo;
  vercel: VercelInfo;
  apps: string[];
  setMetadata: (data: Partial<Metadata>) => void;
  setGithub: (data: Partial<GithubInfo>) => void;
  setGithubInstallId: (id: number) => void;
  setVercel: (data: Partial<VercelInfo>) => void;
  setApps: (apps: string[]) => void;
  getFullConfig: () => Config;
  clearAll: () => void;
};
````

Note: All data is client-side only. No refresh persistence for now.
