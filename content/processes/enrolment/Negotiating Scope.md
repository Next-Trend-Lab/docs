## **Scope-Driven Context & Complexity in Hub Enrollment**

**Policy Statement:**  
The depth and detail of information we request from potential hub partners during the enrollment process will **vary according to the intended scope of our partnership mandate** with each hub.

**Rationale:**

- **Not all partnerships are the same.** Some hubs may simply co-host an Action Learning Journey (ALJ) with us, where we act as facilitators and do not take responsibility for outcomes. Others may seek deep, long-term collaboration, shared ownership, or co-design of new systems and infrastructure.
    
- **Efficiency and respect:** We do not want to burden hubs with unnecessary complexity or ask for information irrelevant to the actual working relationship.
    
- **Clarity and alignment:** By scaling the form’s complexity to match the partnership’s intended depth, we avoid misunderstandings about roles, responsibilities, and accountability.
    

**How This Works in Practice:**

- **Level 1 (Screening):** For hubs where our role is limited (e.g., simple co-organization, minimal shared risk), the form is short and direct—focused on essential facts: mission, governance, space, culture, and dealbreakers. This enables a quick “go/no-go” decision.
    
- **Level 2 (Service Readiness):** If we are considering providing more capacity, resources, or shared ownership, we request more detail: operational processes, accountability systems, tech stack, stakeholder mapping, and internal challenges.
    
- **Level 3 (Co-Creation):** For hubs where we may co-design or co-own outcomes, we ask for even deeper context: theory of change, partnership history, decision-making frameworks, economic and legal structures, and history of collaboration.
    
- **Level 4 (Long-Term Collaboration):** For strategic, ongoing partnerships, we engage in joint planning, formal agreements, and mutual capacity assessments.


> “The level of detail we ask for here is based on the scope of our intended partnership. If we move forward together, we’ll explore more context and complexity as needed.”
