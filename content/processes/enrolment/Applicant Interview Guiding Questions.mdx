# Interview Question Guidance
These questions are **not checklists** — they’re invitations to the interviewer to _listen with depth_, to _feel into the flow of the dialogue_, and to _tune into the candidate’s essence, roles, and potential contribution_ to a collective process of emergence.
## Interviewer Guidance – Listening Across Three Domains

> These prompts are not for interrogation, but to support a **relational field of inquiry**. Be present, curious, and notice both what is said and how it’s said — what energies are alive, what is emerging in this interaction?

## 1. Technical Background – Capacities for Shaping and Navigating Innovation

**What to listen for:**
Capabilities for engaging with technical systems — not only in skill, but in orientation: how do they meet the unknown? How do they respond to the _conditions of complexity_ through prototyping, sensing, and iteration?

**Guiding prompts:**

- In what ways have you participated in shaping or adapting technical systems? What roles do you find yourself naturally taking in these spaces?
- How do you approach learning or working with unfamiliar tools or technologies?
- What energises you in prototyping or creating from scratch — especially when the path isn't clear?
- Can you share a time when your technical work was shaped by or responded to the context or community around it?
- How do you hold both the precision of technology and the messiness of emergence?

## 2. Teamwork & Collaboration – Capacities for Alignment and Emergence

**What to listen for:**  
Relational dynamics. What roles or archetypes do they inhabit in groups? Are they facilitators of coherence? Disruptors of stagnation? How do they attend to group process? What’s their impulse in the face of misalignment or divergence?

**Guiding prompts:**

- What patterns do you notice in yourself when you work in groups — especially ones with diverse roles and disciplines?
- How do you respond when something needs to shift in a team but no one is directing it?
- Tell us about a time when something surprising or emergent happened in a collaboration. What was your role in it?
- How do you tend to moments of friction or misalignment in group settings?
- What becomes possible in a space when you feel fully aligned with others?

## 3. Connection to Place & Identity – Capacities for Groundedness and Responsiveness

**What to listen for:**  
A felt sense of identity as dynamic and situated. Curiosity and humility about place. Readiness to listen and co-shape with the living systems of land, culture, and history. Are they moved by the uniqueness of context?

**Guiding prompts:**

- What places have shaped you, and how do they live in you today?
- How do you orient to unfamiliar places or communities? What becomes most important to you in that process?
- In what ways do you sense or respond to the energy and flows of a place or system?
- How do you understand your purpose or contribution in relationship to the communities you engage with?
- What are you listening for when arriving in a new context?

# Notes for the Interviewer

- Listen for **coherence** between what they say and how they say it.
- Notice **where their energy rises** — that’s often where their deeper roles and impulses lie.
- Be open to people who are early in their journey but show strong signals of alignment and potential
- This is not about perfection — it’s about sensing **resonance with a living, emergent learning journey**.
