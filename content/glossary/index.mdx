# Writing
This folder contains a glossary to help make our documentation clearer and more engaging. Our goal is to ensure that every term feels fresh and intuitive, so readers come away with a better understanding each time they visit. Writing for a diverse audience while keeping a cohesive voice is no small task, but here’s how the Prisma team approaches it:

1. Write as if your most attentive reader is paying close attention.
2. Be as clear and accurate as possible—good writing turns inspiration into reality.
3. For complex topics, use precise language and provide context when needed by adding to this glossary.
