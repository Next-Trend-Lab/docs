The greater whole: European states need to transition to higher percentage of protected spaces by 2050, with a milestone at 2030:

- 2050 - 30%
- 2030 - 20%

Spain is below that. Many countries below that.

The classification has rules, but no one managing it. Public administration can't manage that because it doesn't have that much surplus. 

There was this program to mobilise the public. The accelerator is part of that. Resilience need to onboard 12 projects into that work. They come from 40 projects that are in the area of Catalunya, including organisations on-the-ground. It doesn't have to be from that programme. 

We all have the same problem of needing to learn how to...

We're holding the question of how we can best support the processes of...

- Citizen science
- Governance
- Monitoring

There's the opportunity to show that doing this bottom-up, on-the-ground, has much more potential than state-led top-down approach. 

1. Top-down approach will always be there: public office inside a park, technical people doing technical things
2. Bottom-up: people obsessively monitoring fireflies and making a book in their free time until parks becomes obsolete - why do that when you can have the people involved. 

Indicators:

- Biodiversity: if governance is done well biodiversity should increase

Citizen science vs. citizen sensing - people just taking pictures of stuff. 

How in touch with the orgs are you after the accelerator? Not as much as they'd like to.

Contribution accounting:

- Hubs are attractors, helps manage complexity. Complexity moves in a certain way around those attractors. 
- Mobilising and/ or managing the people around 
- Restraint on sociocratic organising and contribtion accounting because the anarchist culture in Catalunya has an inertia against being asked to formalise in any particular way that they might not necessarily want to.

Purpose of accelerator: producing case-studies like the river project that are examples of really democracitally commonizing a natural space. 

Potential:

- Evolving democracy
- Circular economy: engage with the river: every link is leading back to making the river healthier
- No separation of people and landscapes, interconnected
- To get there we need to make decisions together
	- Currently, if you try to talk to people they will shout at you
	- Or they want to do it horizontally until you exhaust yourself and reach consensus
- These are key capabilities that municipalities don't currently have
- So we need to ...
