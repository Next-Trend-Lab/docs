# Introduction
Prisma organises transformation-oriented events. We integrate regenerative design, facilitation and innovation to create the conditions for highly participatory, engaged and emergent <span className="text-prisma-b">collective action</span>. Our events are like <span className="text-prisma-b">a new kind of hackathon</span>, and our last event took place in [Accra](/events/accra), lasting two weeks. Working with one on-the-ground hub in Accra and a partner in the Northern region, we managed to cover:

- Systems thinking and complexity
- Community outreach and intervention design
- Self-organising, leadership and roles
- Decentralised decision-making
- Values system design, leading to...
- Community-led evaluation and funding distribution
- Cardano training
- A field trip 7 hours north
- Pitch day presentations
- Professional footage of interviews with each of the team leads
- A dedicated digital commons for the hub (more below)
- 400+ queryable reflection entries, through our in-house, voice-based, participatory story-making system, which is publicly available for a limited period at [evaluate](https://evaluate.prisma.events)
- Developing three inter-disciplinary teams working on three completely different, self-identified systems. Two of these teams are now developing into fully-fledged organisations, still working on their projects almost 3 months later. The combined funding applications made since the "hackathon" are well over $100k. These are not just codebases. These are genuine pathways to greater community vitality that those teams are finding and developing for themselves. The depth and breadth of these projects is not a coincidence - it's exactly what Prisma is designed for. 

We know what we're doing. Some of the specialities we draw upon to do our work include:

- Social Movement Organising
- Social and Emotional Learning
- Software Engineering and Data Analytics
- Regenerative Design

These are not buzzwords, to us. They're fields of study which our team has been training in for several years if not decades. 

We provide a [minimum viable infrastructure](/patterns/minimum-viable-infrastructure) package to select partners to organise an event.

# Offer
This document outlines how Prisma aims to enable the development of <span className="text-prisma-b">40 projects</span> in the run-up to the Cardano Summit. These projects will be regionally relevant, designed with regenerative principles in mind, and made possible by building a chain of facilitator capacity through the Wada hub network.
