**Roles, Responsibilities and Domain CATS**

Purpose of CATS: 

CATS26 is the first Cardano summit in Africa to be shaped this way; not a single event, but a living process.  
It is technology guided by culture to support local useful use-cases.  
It is Africa remembering itself in code, art, and community.

**Prisma Role:** 

To organise and facilitate a programme of hackathons leading up to CATS, through which we will onboard developers and create showcases of projects integrating Cardano.

**Prisma Responsibilities:**

* To build the capacity of the hubs to organise their own hackathons.   
* To provide event organising infrastructure which can be used and modified for them to be able to organise the hackathons in their own way.  
  * To deploy the publishing stack that complements and empowers organisational processes to facilitate hubs and participants to incubate and showcase their software projects in a way that is characteristic of their hub and place.  
* To engage all necessary stakeholders in learning about working with living systems from a regenerative approach.   
* Design the learning process that will lead the hubs and participants to engage with real local community problem statements that will be the base of their projects.  
* To provide organisational clarity for stakeholders to be able to participate in emergent and aligned action leading up to the summit.   
* To apply social technology in a way that meets stakeholders where they are at whilst still maintaining depth, integrity and rigour of working in a way aligned with regenerative principles.  
* Verify communication regarding hackathon aligns with Prisma capability and scope

**Prisma Domain:** 

Our main purpose is to enhance the experience of the lead-up to the CATS event. Our domains:

- From the enrolment process to the hackathon phase, up to the end of the Nairobi intensive  
- Enrolment and hackathon: facilitating self-organising in alignment with CATS aims  
- For Nairobi intensive: the learning process of the event, i.e. create a deepening of experience of the projects that have already been created (during the hackathons)

Frontiers/ boundaries

- Not calling participants in: we are helping them to design the taster, form, and roles, but not doing the promotion (marketing)  
- Facilitating calls, designing agendas, training the learning process of the hackathon, offering guidance into developing their own hackathons, but not responsible for delivering them  
- Not responsible for them having the functional capabilities required to build their projects from a technical perspective  
- Not responsible for the contents of the publications (code/ contents of projects and showcases)

**Tabs Role:** 

- Principal representative and final risk-bearer of Prisma  
- First point of contact  
- Understanding of the whole  
- Adaptation, direction and development of processes (hackathon) and infrastructure (publishing stack) to serve the purpose for which Prisma has been enlisted into CATS

**Tabs Responsibility:** 

- Be a communication bridge between Prisma and stakeholders to unlock participation and success of the hackathons.   
- Delivery and deployment of infrastructure in a timely manner.   
- Align the social (hackathon) and the technical (publishing stack) components of Prisma in such a way that it brings self-organising capability to the CATS hackathon system in service to its purpose and growth trajectory.  
- Additional technical support at the preliminary stages to get the ball rolling (landing page, event page, onboarding forms, calendar management, preliminary onboarding)

**Tabs Domain:** 

- Quality assurance for both the social and technical service offerings and delivery into the program of hackathons   
- Ensuring identification and fulfilment of hackathon program value propositions from Prisma to hubs, participants, and partner organising teams, in alignment with CATS as a whole

**Delfi Role:**

To design, develop and facilitate the practices and processes of the enrolment and hackathon phase leading up to and including the ALJ in Nairobi, ensuring that its quality is imbued with the character of local communities. 

**Delfi Responsibilities:**

- To organize and curate the calls and the learning processes that will take participants to fulfill their role towards the summit.   
- Train hubs and participants in the use of the learning process that walks alongside the learning tools that Carlosâ€™s role is developing, teaching not what and how, but why.   
- Accompany hubs and participants in their exploration to identify problem statements during the hackathons.  
- Design the agendas of the tasters, enrolment, and guiding the design of agendas for hackathons and the ALJ, coordinating with all stakeholders and facilitators involved.  
- Design the deepening of the projects through a living systems lens during the Nairobi ALJ. 

**Delfi Domain:** 

- To ensure that all practices and processes from the launch of the event onwards (specially during the enrollment phase, hackathons and ALJ) are coherent with the vision and values of the CATS Summit.   
- Design and facilitation of the learning exploration that ends with the problems statements through a lens of regenerative principles.    
- Ongoing support as thinking partner for hubs and participants until CATS.
