# **Software License and Deployment Agreement**

**Effective upon digital acceptance (“Deploy” action)**
Between **Prisma** (“Licensor”) and each verified deployment participant or organization (“Licensee”).

---

## **1. Purpose and Grant**

Licensor provides access to the **Prisma Publishing Stack** (and related modules, tools, and infrastructure) for the sole purpose of administering, managing, and executing activities within the **CATS Program**.

Licensor grants Licensee a **limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license** to deploy and operate the software solely within this purpose.
All other uses are prohibited.

---

## **2. Deployment Conditions**

1. Deployment is permitted **only through Licensor’s authorized deployment process**, requiring authentication with a verified Cardano wallet and signature of a nonce issued by the system.
2. The act of deploying the software after authentication constitutes **electronic acceptance** of these terms.
3. Licensee must:

   * Maintain the integrity of deployment credentials and prevent unauthorized access;
   * Use only verified and signed artifacts provided by Licensor;
   * Accept and apply updates, security patches, or configuration changes issued by Licensor;
   * Preserve all embedded attribution, digital signatures, or blockchain records of authorship.
4. Any modification, redeployment, or operation outside the authorized process constitutes **material breach** and immediate termination of all rights.

---

## **3. Intellectual Property**

All rights, title, and interest in and to the Prisma Publishing Stack—including source code, documentation, algorithms, and design—remain the **exclusive property of Licensor**.
Licensee receives no ownership, title, or derivative rights.
Licensee may not reverse-engineer, copy, adapt, or redistribute the software, or make it publicly available under open-source or similar licenses without prior written approval.

---

## **4. Data, Security, and Transparency**

1. Licensee acknowledges that Licensor may record deployment metadata (including wallet address, timestamp, event name, and T&Cs hash) and may anchor authorship or deployment records to a public blockchain for verification purposes.
2. Licensee shall comply with all applicable data protection laws and implement reasonable safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure or alteration of the software or related data.

---

## **5. Attribution**

A non-prominent “Powered by Prisma” notice or digital attribution may appear within the deployed system and related metadata. Licensee may not remove or obscure it.

---

## **6. Termination and Revocation**

Licensor may revoke or suspend Licensee’s deployment rights immediately if Licensee:

* Misuses the software, breaches these terms, or fails to maintain security controls;
* Attempts to deploy or modify the software outside authorized channels; or
* Ceases participation in the CATS Program.

Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use of the software and delete all copies.

---

## **7. Limitation of Liability**

Except for willful misconduct or gross negligence, Licensor shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use or inability to use the software.

---

## **8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of **[insert jurisdiction, e.g., Germany or England & Wales]**, and any disputes shall be resolved before the competent courts of **[insert city]**.

---

## **9. Digital Acceptance**

By selecting “Deploy,” connecting a verified Cardano wallet, and signing the deployment nonce, the Licensee:

* Confirms identity and authority to act for the corresponding organization;
* Agrees that such digital signature constitutes a **legally binding acceptance** under applicable electronic-signature laws; and
* Accepts all terms of this Agreement as of the deployment timestamp.
