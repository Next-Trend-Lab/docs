Three teams formed during the Cardano-based Accra [ALJ](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys). A summarisation video is available [here](/events/accra), and an interactive timeline is queryable at [evaluate.prisma.events](https://evaluate.prisma.events).

# What makes the ALJ model different? 

The approach. ALJs are bringing a deep understanding of what working with living systems regeneratively truly means - from the regenerative design space into web3, not the other way around. 

Place-sourcing projects is a delicate art, requiring subtle and sensitive awareness to what is truly alive in a given place. We have designed all of our processes to be taking shape in, by and through [Place](/glossary/Place) as much as possible, limiting how much of this work can be scaled across places, in a copy-and-paste manner, producing many projects that are all essentially the same: top-down, mechanistic, and often tainted with a basic ignorance to unquestioned assumptions originating from a colonial paradigm, even if that’s not the intention.

Prisma’s direction is to maintain context depth, by providing narrative infrastructure that enables communities on-the-ground to engage external partners in their work without expropriating their stories, their identities, and what makes them who they really are.

The depth of the projects themselves comes, at a high level, from the learning design baked into our programme facilitation, which requires teams to regenerate their approach to observing their communities, as systems, seeing possibilities for interventions that could unlock new capabilities in the process. This happens prior to the intensive (basically a hackathon), so that when they start hacking, they’re hacking with the quality of truly caring about what they’re working on.

They see real needs. They’re not building for getting it done, getting the bag and moving on. They’re building because they’re going to bring this to their communities, and because they’re already stepping into the leadership required to drive that work forwards, through uncertainty and resistance. This sincerity is what makes these teams resilient. The viability comes from the nature of action-learning. We don’t care about concepts, we want teams to act, identifying what roles are needed to materialise their visions. Through an action-learning journey, teams begin to coordinate amongst themselves and build the multiple forms of capacity needed by an interdisciplinary team to address their organisational development holistically (inc. market-oriented engagements). As well as their own revenue/ funding sources, we provide the case-study publishing stack as a means for engaging a broader audience with their work, including funders.
