Three teams formed during the Cardano-based Accra [ALJ](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys). A summarisation video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mNMS114Kss), and an interactive timeline is queryable at [evaluate.prisma.events](https://evaluate.prisma.events).

# Bin to Cash

Working on flooding, by addressing proper waste management, the BtC team is building a participatory coordination system that connects three stakeholders through a monthly token fund distribution:

1. Waste creators - households that produce waste
2. Waste collectors - a vital local economy in Accra
3. Recycling companies

The premise is that recycling companies would finance the fund to be able to receive higher volumes of sorted trash. Think Bolt/ Uber for sorting and collecting waste. Read more [here](https://www.arcaccra.com/ALJ%20Intensive/Teams/Bin%20to%20Cash/Home/).

# CarPool / UrbanLink

The CarPool team identified a gap in the transportation offerings available to the growing corporate worker economy. Currently, the choice essentially boils down to either 

a. Public minibuses, which are often a generally unpleasant experience for the regular commuter
b. Private cars, which contribute further to Accra’s already heavily congested roads

By identifying this gap, they could begin working on their response: a scale-appropriate service, that carried forward the best of both: cost saving of ride sharing, with the comfort of a private service. CarPool is a private shuttle service for corporate employees, providing an enjoyable commute experience as a service, with Cardano-based payment cards for tap-and-go boarding, loyalty perks, and booking management. 

# Bars on Bars

Having lost several friends to addiction, the Bars on Bars team are working on community wellbeing, by addressing the stigma of going to counseling. It is well-known that counseling works best in-person. However, although there are in-person counseling hubs across the city, no one goes, because of the stigma. Bars on Bars are building a hybrid remote and in-person service, which bridges the gap between the moment when individuals first realised the need for support, and the time when they’re ready to go in-person, gaining from an initial period online to build up their confidence to show up in person, ready to make a change. This team was exploring zk-proofs for safeguarding privacy. 

# What makes the ALJ model different? 

The approach. ALJs are bringing a deep understanding of what working with living systems regeneratively truly means - from the regenerative design space into web3, not the other way around.

Place-sourcing projects is a delicate art, requiring subtle and sensitive awareness to what is truly alive in a given place. We have designed all of our processes to be taking shape in, by and through [Place](/glossary/Place) as much as possible, limiting how much of this work can be scaled across places, in a copy-and-paste manner, producing many projects that are all essentially the same: top-down, mechanistic, and often tainted with a basic ignorance to unquestioned assumptions originating from a colonial paradigm, even if that’s not the intention.

Prisma’s direction is to maintain context depth, by providing narrative infrastructure that enables communities on-the-ground to engage external partners in their work without expropriating their stories, their identities, and what makes them who they really are.

The depth of the projects themselves comes, at a high level, from the learning design baked into our programme facilitation, which requires teams to regenerate their approach to observing their communities, as systems, seeing possibilities for interventions that could unlock new capabilities in the process. This happens prior to the intensive (basically a hackathon), so that when they start hacking, they’re hacking with the quality of truly caring about what they’re working on.

They see real needs. They’re not building for getting it done, getting the bag and moving on. They’re building because they’re going to bring this to their communities, and because they’re already stepping into the leadership required to drive that work forwards, through uncertainty and resistance. This sincerity is what makes these teams resilient. The viability comes from the nature of action-learning. We don’t care about concepts, we want teams to act, identifying what roles are needed to materialise their visions. Through an action-learning journey, teams begin to coordinate amongst themselves and build the multiple forms of capacity needed by an interdisciplinary team to address their organisational development holistically (inc. market-oriented engagements). As well as their own revenue/ funding sources, we provide the case-study publishing stack as a means for engaging a broader audience with their work, including funders.
