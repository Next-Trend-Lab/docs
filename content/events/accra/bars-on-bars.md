# Bars on Bars

Having lost several friends to addiction, the Bars on Bars team are working on community wellbeing, by addressing the stigma of going to counseling. It is well-known that counseling works best in-person. However, although there are in-person counseling hubs across the city, no one goes, because of the stigma. Bars on Bars are building a hybrid remote and in-person service, which bridges the gap between the moment when individuals first realised the need for support, and the time when theyâ€™re ready to go in-person, gaining from an initial period online to build up their confidence to show up in person, ready to make a change. This team was exploring zk-proofs for safeguarding privacy.
