# Bin to Cash

Working on flooding, by addressing proper waste management, the BtC team is building a participatory coordination system that connects three stakeholders through a monthly token fund distribution:

1. Waste creators - households that produce waste
2. Waste collectors - a vital local economy in Accra
3. Recycling companies

The premise is that recycling companies would finance the fund to be able to receive higher volumes of sorted trash. Think Bolt/ Uber for sorting and collecting waste. Read more [here](https://www.arcaccra.com/ALJ%20Intensive/Teams/Bin%20to%20Cash/Home/).
