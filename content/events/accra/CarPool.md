# CarPool

The CarPool team identified a gap in the transportation offerings available to the growing corporate worker economy. Currently, the choice essentially boils down to either 

a. Public minibuses, which are often a generally unpleasant experience for the regular commuter
b. Private cars, which contribute further to Accraâ€™s already heavily congested roads

By identifying this gap, they could begin working on their response: a scale-appropriate service, that carried forward the best of both: cost saving of ride sharing, with the comfort of a private service. CarPool is a private shuttle service for corporate employees, providing an enjoyable commute experience as a service, with Cardano-based payment cards for tap-and-go boarding, loyalty perks, and booking management.
