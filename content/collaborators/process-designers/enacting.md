# Purpose of the Role
The purpose of the enacting role is to develop the processes by which participants of an [action-learning journey](patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) (ALJ) are able to embody and act-out a systemic intervention in place, balancing the delivery of functional requirements with whole-system actualisation. 

# Domains of Practice
### Design

- The overall movement that the ALJ facilitation is holding - i.e. the action of a given ALJ as a whole.
- Key evaluation touchpoints that generate the data necessary to make visible key differences in approach:
	- Living systems vs. mechanistic
	- Pedagogical vs. depositing
	- Place-sourced vs. copy-paste
	- Complexity-aware vs. reductionist
	- etc...
- The developmental and pedagogical aspects of the action - how the process will be rich with learnings in a way that is meaningful to the place in which the ALJ is hosted. 
- Learning resources that participants can draw upon to engage with the facilitation.

### Facilitation

- Awareness and sensitivity of how the action design will meet the ongoing hub activity and potential of place.
- Designing key calls, workshops and activities to materialise the action process designed.
- Offering insights and interventions to nudge and unblock energies during the intensive.

### Organisation

- Introduction of key practices internally to the facilitator group to ensure key learning capabilities are being developed
- Clarification of roles needed to take aligned action toward the organisation's purpose
- Restraint on the approach to infrastructure development in order to maintain living systems integrity

- Communicating the limitations and possibilities of technology in an alive and emotional world. 
- Drawing from the development and application of ALJs (and/ or other relevant experience, such as other applications of social technology) to co-design with... 
	- Developers within action-learning teams as they build their place-unique integrations, as well as
	- Developers internal to prisma as they build ALJ participation tooling and distributed ALJ whole-system infrastructure. 
- Publishing a case-study per ALJ.
	- Communicating the application of practice
	- Communicating learnings generated: what was unexpected, novel, stagnant, challenging, easy...
	- Communicating the limitations of the practice in reality vs. the theory and ideal
	- Communicating how the practice itself evolved through the course of the ALJ
