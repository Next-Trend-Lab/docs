## **About North Star Transition**

North Star Transition is a UK-based, not-for-profit organisation with a unique hybrid structure (part private limited company, part charity) dedicated to accelerating systemic change toward a regenerative future. Founded to address **systemic barriers that prevent corporations and institutions from making positive, lasting impacts**, their work bridges the worlds of business, ecosystems, and community-led change.

### **Their Core Focus**

* **Unblocking corporate & institutional action** — removing systemic, financial, and governance barriers to regeneration.

* **Transition Labs** — place-based, multi-stakeholder processes that:

  * Convene actors across sectors and interests.

  * Identify and dismantle barriers to desired change.

  * Co-create **transformational**, **locally owned**, and **financially viable** interventions.

* **Regional grounding** — adapting priorities and interventions to the local context (e.g. agriculture, river health, renewable energy).

* **Regenerative ethics** — aligning finance, governance, and action with outcomes that restore ecosystems, reduce inequality, and heal communities.

We see **North Star Transition as a key node in the planetary network of regenerative catalysts** — uniquely positioned to merge systemic regeneration principles with the capacity to influence corporate and institutional behaviour at scale.

## **Why We See Them as a Core Ally**

Their approach to Transition Labs embodies the *core ethic* of the regenerative movement:

* Multi-stakeholder collaboration

* Localisation & place-based priorities

* Sustainable, non-grant-dependent financing

* Action designed to shift whole systems, not just individual projects

This aligns strongly with our mission at Prisma to **equip regenerative catalysts with the social and technological tools to accelerate system transitions**.
