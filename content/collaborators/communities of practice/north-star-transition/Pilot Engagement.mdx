# Pilot Engagement

<PageGate requiredPassword="norstapri123">

	We propose co-creating a pilot that integrates the ChatALJ (Chat + Action Learning Journey) toolkit into an upcoming Transition Lab. This pilot will focus on enhancing North Star Transition’s capacity to capture, connect, and act on the wealth of insight generated in these multi-stakeholder settings.

	## Pilot Objectives
	
	1. ### Strengthen the hub relationship
		- 	Develop trust and alignment with the selected regional hub hosting the Transition Lab.
	2. ### Integrate hub & methodology into ChatALJ
		- Configure the technology to reflect both the hub’s priorities and North Star’s methodological approach.
	3. ### Deploy infrastructure & onboard participants
		- Provide the technical and operational setup for ChatALJ, including participant onboarding to timelining practices.
	4. ### Enable data capture & deep analysis
		- Support structured, high-quality data collection (voice notes, transcriptions, mapped connections) and apply advanced analysis to reveal systemic patterns, leverage points, and opportunities for coordinated action.

	## Case-studies as Developmental Accounts

	## Pilot Offer

	### Investment: To be decided together
	### Scope: ChatALJ deployment for one selected Transition Lab event
	### Outcomes:
	- Tested, ready-to-scale integration of ChatALJ into North Star’s Transition Lab process.
	- Enhanced capacity for systemic insight mapping and strategic follow-through across regions.
	- A documented case study for replication across other labs and regions.
