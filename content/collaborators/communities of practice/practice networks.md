# practice networks
prisma is a distributed incubator for communities of [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) and on-the-ground [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md) to self-organise [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md).

we're working closely with [Regenesis](/collaborators/communities%20of%20practice/Regenesis.md) [^1], who are evolving a practice of regenerative development and design. 

at the core of our [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md) is the dynamic interplay between the forward movement of [enacting](/processes/enactment) (action) and the ongoing, reflective and integrative movement of [evaluating](/processes/evaluation) (learning). our work is to develop these methodologies and the infrastructures supporting organising such events. 

[action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) are a period of rapid innovation, guided by a facilitator team that has been co-designing with the [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md) for a number of months - each event requiring several months of intention development, co-design, alignment and systems onboarding.[^2] 

we are designing a [minimum viable governance system](minimum viable governance system) to support...

1. External capability development of event [participants](participants)
	- code, [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) and [product](product) quality
	- [place](/glossary/Place.md)-unique (digital) expressions of developmental inquiries into the essence of place [^3]
2. Internal capability development
	- the facilitator team's capability to work with the underlying, generative patterns for organising [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) 
	- increasing order of outcome

both streams are in service to activating and making visible the multiple forms of value creation and exchange involved in thriving regenerative community. these events are developed in partnership with [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md), with a core steward (group), and in partnership with regional hubs. the aim is for the event to be a catalytic agent for the self-expression of place-sourced practices, developed and applied to grow bioregional wealth.

> *aims to* apply this governance system to facilitate the self-organising of place-sourced [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md)â€¦
> 
> *in order to* produce a suite of developmental case studies that engage a broader (global) audience with the work of regenerative development and design
> 
> *in a way that* enables practitioners working on-the-ground to communicate the essence of their work **themselves** 
> 
> *so that* the instrument used to communicate the application of practice can evolve **with** the community of practice and the evolving practice itself.

# Stakeholder Groups
event capacities are sourced from at least the following four stakeholder groups:

1. participants
2. [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md)
3. [practice networks](/collaborators/communities%20of%20practice/practice%20networks.md)
4. partners

these [stakeholder development pathways](https://register.prisma.events) are being designed to form a 4-8 month onboarding process. 

the [process-infrastructuring](/processes/process-infrastructuring) developed to support the organisation of each event instance is also designed to be configurable and self-contained, able to be deployed to a server/ device network local to the [hubs](/collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md) hosting the event. the purpose of this is to align with the aim of building capacity in-place for ongoing development of the products incubated during the intensive. 
# Instrumenting
instruments supporting this process design are:

- [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md) [publishing](/processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing.md) stack - an interface into [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md)
- [patterns for facilitator teams](patterns for facilitator teams) - see [liberating structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/)
- reputation - participant registrations, contribution accounting and participation timelines
- Organisational agreements-making, serving [intensives as incubation processes](intensives as incubation processes)
- [practice-currencies](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies.md) and [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) DAOs

[^3]: The creative tension of glocal: visibility and verification of local network effect at global-scale levels of capital distribution. mediating multiple forms of evaluation and communicating success cases of application of practice. global systemic crises (are [complex systems](complex systems) and) require vast amounts of thinking processing in order to respond collectively and regeneratively. evolving systems at those scales whilst at the same time in alignment with the continuity of life on earth requires place-specific practices. [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) has the role of developing ecological literacy (seeing patterns in nature).
