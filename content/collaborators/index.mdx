- Participants: individuals like artists, developers, and single contributors 
- Communities of Practice: networks of systems change practices
- Communities of Place: hubs and locals, those representing a bioregion
- Partners: technology providers, institutions, agencies, government bodies

If you feel called to contribute, co-create, or explore alignment, we invite you to register below.
