# Action-Learning Journeys
Action-Learning Journeys (ALJs) are structured processes designed to bring communities into an active state of co-design and system transformation. They serve as incubators for new governance models, economic mechanisms, and regenerative practices, aligning local action with systemic impact.

An ALJ is a time-bound process in which a cohort of participants engages in learning-by-doing, designing and implementing practice-based economic structures within a given bioregion. This occurs through a phased process that includes preparation, intensive in-person collaboration, and iterative evaluation.

The [Replace Academy Case Study](/context%20&%20narrative/Replace%20Academy%20Case%20Study.md) is an example from a previous action-learning journey, which created the [aspect](aspect) of knowledge commoning.

Key Roles in an ALJ:

| **Stakeholder**                      | **Role**                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Participants**                     | Individuals engaging in **on-the-ground experimentation** and practice-currency co-creation. |
| **Communities of Place**             | Bioregional nodes stewarding **place-based transformation**.                                 |
| **Communities of Practice**          | Emerging fields of **systems-change practitioners**, refining **new models of governance**.  |
| **Technology & Governance Partners** | Infrastructure providers supporting **verifiable execution of agreements**.                  |
| **Funders & Investors**              | Aligning capital flows with **distributed regenerative value creation**.                     |

# Outputs & Systemic Impact

- Incubation of DAOs: ALJs serve as the grounding mechanism for new governance structures.
- [practice-currencies](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies) & Mutual-Credit Systems: Financial mechanisms emerge as expressions of verified actions.
- Self-[publishing](processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing.md) [case-studies](patterns/case-study.md): ALJs document knowledge, forming a living archive of regenerative transitions.
- Scaling via [hubs](collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md): ALJs act as the scaffolding for broader ecosystems, enabling new regional actors to onboard more autonomously.
