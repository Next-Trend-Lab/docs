# Action-Learning Journeys
An action-learning journey is an event. It's an accumulation of energy oriented toward system transformation. The most critical moments of an action-learning journeys are the intensives. Intensives are hosted by community [hubs](collaborators/communities%20of%20place/hubs.md) on-the-ground. The intensive in [Accra](events/accra.mdx), for example, lasted two weeks. 

Action-learning journeys as a whole are incubators of governance evolution, future economy, social innovation and [more](glossary/Practice.md), all originating from participatory co-design to align action with local [system potential](glossary/place-sourced%20potential.md). The intensives are the time to embody those visions, to materialise those expressions of what could be - as an intervention into the systems of focus: health, food, water systems, systems of storytelling and narratives, of eldership and care, of financing and justice. 

The [enrolment](processes/enrolment/index.mdx) period is a time of creating the conditions necessary to build the social container for participants to feel free and able to literally [enact](processes/enactment/index.md) system potential. This requires active participation: every participant in an action-learning journey is playing an active role. 

An ALJ is a time-bound process in which a cohort of participants engages in learning-by-doing, designing and implementing practice-based economic structures within a given bioregion. This occurs through a phased process that includes preparation, intensive in-person collaboration, and iterative evaluation.
