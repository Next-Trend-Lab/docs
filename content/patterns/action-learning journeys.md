# Action-Learning Journeys
Action-Learning Journeys (ALJs) are structured processes designed to bring communities into an active state of co-design and system transformation. They serve as incubators for new governance models, economic mechanisms, and regenerative practices, aligning local action with systemic impact.

An ALJ is a time-bound process in which a cohort of participants engages in learning-by-doing, designing and implementing practice-based economic structures within a given bioregion. This occurs through a phased process that includes preparation, intensive in-person collaboration, and iterative evaluation.
