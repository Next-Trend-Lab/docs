# The Essence of Prisma

To create safe _and_ radical learning spaces where diverse roles integrate regenerative design and innovation to produce new forms of organisation and technologies aligned with the health of their ecosystems.

# Our Premises
- All the products and services we develop must respond to the essence of Prisma.
- All learning designs must respond to local potential and carry regenerative virtues.
- All our products must harmonize social and technological innovation.
- Prisma evaluates its positive and negative impacts in the short, medium and long term through collective projection. (Collective reflection process for continuous transformation.)

# Sociocratic Organising 

An organising impulse that social groups form around, begins with a seed of potential. To work on this potential is this group's purpose that calls them in to the organising activity. By answering this call, they together form a collective body that springs to life in response. This purpose is the first mandate item.
# Mandate
The following list outlines a mandate by which the social group self-identifies:

1. Purpose
2. Accountabilities
	1. Roles - the entity taking responsibility for the accountabilities, who can also delegate
	2. E.g. Tooling
3. Domains
4. Vision & Mission
	1. Vision: an image, enlivening
	2. Mission: milestones and outcomes
5. Principles & Values (plus ways of working)

The most effective organising happens when coordination is shared.
