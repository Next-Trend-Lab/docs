## What Is a Hub?

For Prisma, a hub is more than just a physical space — it’s a living, local anchor for transformation and learning. A hub acts as a nest: it holds, promotes, and stewards opportunities for action-based learning, community activation, and co-designed innovation.

**Purpose of a Hub**

A hub exists to support people in exploring the sense of place of their local community, and to help design services, systems, and products that enable that community’s potential and evolution.

It does this by:

* Creating the conditions for learning through doing  
* Surfacing what is alive  
* Holding space for deep collaboration and trust-building (elders and other local actors)  
* Serving as the base for hosting an Action Learning Journey (ALJ) intensive  
* Integrating multiple aspects of systems change over time  
* Growing the capacity of place as a whole, coordinating with all teams 

### What Can a Hub Look Like?

Hubs take many forms, depending on local context and leadership. They might be:

* Community centers  
* Bioregional learning spaces  
* Cooperatives or DAO-style collectives  
* Co-living / co-working spaces with a regional focus  
* Living labs or regenerative projects

What they all share is a commitment to place, a sense of its political wills, a capacity for hosting, and a readiness to self-organize in alignment with Prisma’s action-learning approach.

### How Does a Hub Get Started?

Every new hub goes through a supported onboarding process, during which it:

* Aligns with Prisma on purpose, roles, and expectations  
* Organizes its first Action Learning Journey with our support  
* Learns to self-publish a case study based on the experience  
* Gains capacity to host future journeys with minimal support

By the end of this process, a hub is not just a host — it’s a local learning node in a wider network of regionally grounded movements.

### Why Become a Hub?

Hubs benefit by:

* Seeing their responsibility in the evolution of their place with greater clarity  
* Growing local leadership and guide innovation trajectories   
* Attracting partners, talent, and investment  
* Amplifying place-based systems change and contributing effectively  
* Publishing learnings that inspire others and generate income  
* Contributing to a wider network of regenerative transformation

### How We Work With Hubs

We tailor our support to the depth of partnership:

* For simple co-hosting, we keep things light.  
* For deeper collaborations, we engage in shared design, accountability, and mutual planning.

No matter the depth, our approach is always:

* Trust-first  
* Alignment-based  
* Place-centered  
* Designed for mutual growth
