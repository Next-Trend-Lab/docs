## The Regenerative Hackathon Model: Cardano Africa Tech Summit (CATS)

Document Type: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) / Approach Documentation

Audience: Next Trend Hub Staff, Event Coordinators, Key Partners

Version: 1.0 (October 2025)

### 1.0 Overview & Core Philosophy

This document outlines the official approach for Next Trend Hub's execution of the Cardano Africa Tech Summit (CATS) Local In-person Hackathon, in collaboration with Wada.

This is not a traditional hackathon model. Our approach is rooted in a Regenerative Principle. The primary goal is not just to build applications, but to identify and foster real-world, community-sourced solutions. This model directly aligns with our mission to build blockchain and AI solutions for societal challenges.
#### 1.1 Guiding Principles

- Bottom-Up, Not Top-Down: We do not provide the problems. Participants source them directly from their local environment.  
  
- Process Over Product: The journey of discovery, iteration, and failure (the "Evolutionary Logbook") is as important as the final demo.  
  
- Local Relevance is Paramount: We are building solutions for Nigeria, by builders in Nigeria.  
  
- Community as Co-Creator: Participants and hub members collectively define the hackathon tracks based on real-world findings.

#### 1.2 Our Mission & Vision Alignment

- Mission: To build blockchain and AI solutions that address societal challenges through decentralization.  
  
	- How this event aligns: By tasking participants with finding real societal challenges, we directly execute this mission.  

- Vision: To be a leading force in technology innovation that empowers communities across Africa.

	- How this event aligns: By teaching cutting-edge tech (Cardano) and fostering a bottom-up innovation culture, we empower our local community to become a leading force.
#### 1.3 Partner Roles & Responsibilities

Wada (Primary Partner)

- Provides the global framework (CATS).
  
- Sets the core philosophy (Regenerative Principle).

- Provides the mandatory submission tooling (Prisma).
  
- Manages the grand prize and continental-level selection (Trip to Nairobi).

Next Trend Hub (Host & Local Executor)

- Manages all on-the-ground logistics (venue, F&B, Wi-Fi).
  
- Recruits and manages local participants, mentors, and judges.
  
- Executes the Orientation and Workshops.
  
- Facilitates the local "Problem Definition" session.
  
- Manages local support and communication (Discord/Slack).

### 2.0 The Participant Journey (Event Lifecycle)

This is the standard flow for a participant, or team from registration to submission.
#### Phase 1: Orientation & Ideation (Day 1)

1. Kick-Off: Formal orientation covering the Hub's mission, the Wada/CATS partnership, and the "Big Picture" (Nairobi showcase).
   
2. Core Concept Introduction: The "Regenerative Principle" is explained. Participants are tasked to look within their local environment for problems.

3. Mandatory Task 1: All teams must conduct initial research (online or in-person) to identify a specific, real-world problem.

4. Mandatory Task 2: Teams must document their findings and prepare to share them with the entire hub.
#### Phase 2: Collective Definition (Day 2 / Day 3)

1. Community "Town Hall": Each team presents their problem findings (1-2 minutes each).

2. Facilitated Discussion: The Hub Lead facilitates a group discussion to identify themes, clusters, and common pain points from the findings.

3. Track Definition: Based on this discussion, the coordinator and participants collectively define the official hackathon tracks (e.g., "Food Security," "Civic Tech," "Supply Chain").

4. Problem Statement Finalized: Each team refines their specific problem statement within one of the newly defined tracks.
#### Phase 3: Hacking & Documentation (Day 3 - 8)

1. Team Formation: Team will be formed withing the Hub community.
   
2. Building Begins: Teams begin development.

3. The Evolutionary Logbook: This is a core requirement. Teams must document their entire process:
   
	- Initial problem research.

	- Pivots and failed ideas.

	- Technical challenges and solutions.

	- Final architecture diagrams.

	- This logbook is maintained in their GitHub repository.

4. Support: Participants are supported via hybrid workshops and mentor check-ins.
#### Phase 4: Submission & Judging (Final Day)

1. Technical Submission: All code and documentation (the Logbook) must be on the team's GitHub Organization.
   
2. Prisma Submission: Teams use the Prisma Tooling (Doc Tool & Propagate App) to deploy and "anchor" their project documentation. This is the official submission.
   
3. Final Demos: Teams present a live pitch and demo to the judging panel.

4. Judging: Judges evaluate teams based on the official criteria (see Section 4.0).

### 3.0 Operational Playbook: Execution Guide

#### 3.1 Orientation Agenda (Standard Flow)

This is the run-of-show for the kick-off presentation.

1. Welcome: Intro to Next Trend Hub (Mission, Vision, Logistics).
   
2. The Big Picture: What is Wada? What is CATS? (The Nairobi Goal).

3. Our Core Theme: The "Regenerative Principle" (Find local problems).

4. Your First Task: The process of research and community sharing.

5. Our Collective Goal: How we will define the tracks together.

6. The "Evolutionary Logbook": Explaining the mandatory documentation.

7. Tech Stack: Intro to Cardano tools (Mesh.js, Aiken, etc.).

8. Submission Process (Critical):

	- Explain the Prisma Doc Tool.

	- List the 3 requirements: GitHub Org, Vercel Account, Cardano Wallet.

9. Judging Criteria: Be transparent about how to win.

10. Next Steps: Team formation and problem-finding begins.
#### 3.2 Technical & Submission Stack (Participant Requirements)

All participants must be informed of these requirements before the hackathon begins.

- Cardano Dev Stack (Recommended):
  
	- Frontend/dApp: Mesh.js SDK

	- Data API: Blockfrost or Koios

	- Smart Contracts: Aiken (preferred) or Plutus

	- Submission Stack (Mandatory):

	- Version Control: A new GitHub Organization account for the team.

	- Deployment: A Vercel account.
    
	- On-Chain Identity: A Cardano Wallet (e.g., Nami, Eternl) to use the Propagate App.
#### 3.3 Support Structure

- Workshops:

	- A minimum of three (3) hybrid workshops must be scheduled.

	- All workshops are physical (at the hub) but must be live-streamed for remote participants.
	  
- Suggested Topics:
  
	1. "Building Your First Cardano dApp with Mesh.js"
   
	2. "Writing Smart Contracts in Aiken"
   
	3. "Submission 101: Using the Prisma Tooling (GitHub, Vercel, Propagate)"

- Mentorship:
  
	- A dedicated team of mentors (technical, business, UI/UX) must be available.

	- A clear system for mentor requests (e.g., WhatsApp group, in-person scheduler) is required.
### 4.0 Judging & Prizes

#### 4.1 Standard Judging Criteria

This framework must be given to all judges and participants.

1. Problem & Local Relevance (30%)
   
	- Clarity and importance of the locally-sourced problem.

	- Does this solution genuinely address a real-world Nigerian challenge?
    
2. Technical Execution & Cardano Integration (30%)

	- Does the demo work?
	  
	- How well did the team utilize the Cardano stack (Mesh.js, Aiken, etc.)?
    
3. Process Documentation (20%)

	- Quality and completeness of the "Evolutionary Logbook."

	- Did they document their journey, pivots, and learnings clearly?

4. Usability & Final Pitch (20%)

	- Is the solution intuitive and well-designed (UI/UX)?
	  
	- Quality and clarity of the final 5-minute presentation.
	  
#### 4.2 Prize Pool Strategy

- Local Prize Pool: Per the user's context, this is often TBD.

	- Note: The local prize pool is a secondary motivator. Our communication should emphasize the long-term value: learning, portfolio-building, and the main prize.
  
- The Grand Prize (Main Motivator):
  
	- The primary prize is the opportunity to be selected by the continental Wada team to advance.
	  
	- This includes the sponsored trip to Nairobi, the in-person boot camp, and the global showcase at CATS.
