Here we outline our business model, showing our approach to scaling systems change through real-world experimentation.

1. [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md): each action-learning journey produces a story. with these stories, we're aiming to make visible the underlying [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) being applied and the learnings that were generated during the intensive. in this way, engaging with this story is developmental. access to these ongoing stories are available for subscription, starting during the lead up to an [action-learning journey](action-learning journey). our work as prisma is to onboard hubs into self-[publishing](/processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing.md) capacity and steward the quality of these stories across the system as a whole. 
2. incubation: [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md) forms action-learning teams. teams become organisations.
3. [evaluation](/processes/evaluation/): Our evaluation process is, at its core, an accounting system. where a small percentage of the value generated is reinvested into future projects, driving both growth and impact.
