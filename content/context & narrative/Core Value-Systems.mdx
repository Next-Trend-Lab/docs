# Core Value Systems

<PageGate requiredPassword="external_evaluat0r">
    Here we outline our three core value systems, showing our approach to scaling systems change through real-world experimentation.

    1. [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md): each action-learning journey produces a story. with these stories, we're aiming to make visible the underlying [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) being applied and the learnings that were generated during the intensive. in this way, engaging with this story is developmental. access to these ongoing stories are available for subscription, starting during the lead up to an [action-learning journey](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md), which we sometimes refer to as an ALJ. our work as prisma is to onboard hubs into self-[publishing](/processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing.md) capacity and steward the quality of these stories across the system as a whole. 
    2. incubation: the participants we sign-up around an ALJ are a cohort. [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md) forms action-learning teams. teams become organisations. Organisations form around a [seed of potential](/patterns/sociocratic%20organising.md). The work of nurturing this seed of potential needs a way to be able to continue beyond the end of the intensive. For that, we're leveraging a delayed dividends model. Part of our work with [ground-potentialising](/processes/ground-potentialising.md) is to engage external evaluators. These are people who would be interested in resourcing to those teams applying practice on-the-ground. In order to instrument the trustfulness of that partnership, we're working to generate verifiably meaningful indicators of that on-the-ground activity. That the [practice-currencies](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies.md) part. To share in the value-creating partnerships formed is one of the extrinsic motivators available to those organising an ALJ. To enter into such trustful, resourcing partnerships is one of the extrinsic motivators available to hubs and the cohorts. Developing a distributed system able to account for that value circulation is what is addressable once ALJs have a sovereign means of sustaining themselves. This is possible if the case-study model becomes one that the hubs would want to buy into. They would need to want to buy into this in order for them to invest themselves into self-organising an ALJ. The [case-study-values-system](case-study-values-system) outlines those alignment of interests in detail. 
    3. [evaluation](/processes/evaluation/): Our evaluation process is, at its core, an accounting system. part of the value generated is reinvested into future projects, driving both growth and impact. Our third value system is practice economy.
