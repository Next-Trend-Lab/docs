prisma is a distributed [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md) incubator. we organise and facilitate [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) so that [bioregional](/glossary/bioregion) communities can participate more fully in transition pathways toward life-affirming futures.

we bring active facilitation to work at three levels of incubation:

1. **PRODUCTS:** Making visible the application of [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) by action-learning groups on-the-ground with developmental [case-studies](/patterns/case-study).
2. **ORGANISATIONS:** Securing longer-term viability of a given team's line of work (practice-DAOs/ action-learning teams).
3. **ECOSYSTEMS:** Multiple levels of actors, partnerships, aims.
