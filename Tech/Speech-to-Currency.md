_Turning intention into tangible value._

Imagine a world where every contribution, every insight, every act of service could be recognized and valued in a way that ripples out to support the entire community. This vision is at the heart of **speech-to-currency** - a mechanism for translating human intention, expressed through language, into tangible value within regenerative systems.

This process enables the community's engagement during action-learning journey to be tangibly measured. When the community's voice are heard, when they are valued and measured, when there's a clear sense of metrics in how the voices get a sense of value, change becomes possible.

## **Reimagining Value Creation**

In traditional economic systems, value is often narrowly defined by financial transactions or material outputs. But in regenerative systems, value is much broader - encompassing ecological health, social equity, cultural vitality, and the countless intangible contributions that sustain thriving communities.

Speech-to-currency offers a way to recognize and reward these diverse forms of value, creating a more equitable and holistic economic landscape. Just as sunlight nourishes a forest, this approach aims to nourish the human spirit, fostering a sense of agency, purpose, and belonging that fuels further transformation.

## **The Core Components**

At its core, speech-to-currency involves:

- **Capturing Human Intention**: Gathering expressions of value through speech - from spoken reflections and workshop dialogues to peer reviews and oral histories.
    
- **Translating Meaning into Metrics**: Using AI and natural language processing to identify key themes, sentiments, and actions within these expressions, quantifying their contributions to specific goals.
    
- **Tokenizing Value**: Assigning value to these contributions through tokens or credits that can be used within a local economy.
    
- **Enabling Circulation**: Facilitating the exchange of these tokens for goods, services, or other forms of support that strengthen the community.
    

## **Speech-to-Currency in Action**

It is more than just a tool â€“ it's a way to recognize value beyond measure. The following case helps to bring this to the forefront:

- **Recognizing Contributions Beyond Metrics**: The program facilitates the recognition of each member's contribution and acknowledges that the role of people within groups and systems have intrinsic value and are therefore valuable to begin with.
    
- **Peer Recognition**: In group settings, the system incentivises positive feedback and acknowledgement within the community.
    
- **Community Building**: It builds and enables communities of practice to take ownership of regenerative activity.
    

By tokenizing their contributions, participants feel recognized for their time, work, and support within a system, incentivizing continuous development and engagement. As more regenerative projects get funded, the community builds momentum to achieve more ambitious plans for their respective bioregions.

## How Speech-to-Currency Could Be Used

1. To incentivize contributions during a regenerative project
    
2. Measure impacts across different levels, from individual to the system as a whole
    
3. Enable communities to have autonomy on regenerative efforts
    
4. The tools we provide can evolve with communities
    

## **A Call to Reimagine**

With this, we urge stakeholders to reimagine and redesign the nature of value itself. In addition, may the framework allow more equal voice in the economy.
